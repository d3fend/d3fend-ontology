# Correlation Control Indicator (CCI) mappings to D3FEND

Generates a set of facts for the CCIs, mapping them to D3FEND
techniques as part of building the extensions. To correct or customize
these, modify the accompanying spreadsheet.  The repeating reference
columns are related to NIST mappings and provide more context, but
these should not be modified or relied on; instead, reference the CCI
List .xml data.

See [CCI Downloads](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/cci/)

Future Potential Work: Process the U_CCI_List.xml available at DoD
Cyber Exchange to also include CCI->NIST mappings. Currently out of
scope.
