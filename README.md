# D3FEND Ontology

This repository holds the necessary content to produce the D3FEND ontology distribution.

- > If you are looking for the latest release of the ontology, please find it [here](https://d3fend.mitre.org/resources/ontology/).

- > If you are interested in contributing to this project, please see our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Overview

> **Note:** if you are looking for the latest D3FEND ontology release please find it [here](https://d3fend.mitre.org/resources/ontology/).

The basic workflow is to edit the `d3fend-protege.ttl` file, save your changes, then simply
run `make all` in this directory. This is designed to accommodate both plain text editing
and Protege Ontology IDE modifications.

When making changes with a text editor please avoid introducing unsubstantial changes
to many lines in the file. This enables efficient code reviews.

> **Note**: before sending a merge request changes to `src/ontology/d3fend-protege.ttl` please always run `make pre-commit` **before** you commit changes or will will not be able to accept the request. :eyes: You can run this automatically (and only against staged files) every commit with `make pre-commit-install`.

## System Dependencies

- java 15.0.1, other versions may work however
- python 3.9
- python pipenv package with `pipenv` in your PATH

## Building

The Makefile has all the necessary targets (commands) needed to build the D3FEND ontology.
Once your system dependencies are installed, Run `make install-deps`, then you can run
`make all` to build the ontology.

> In order to run `make build/d3fend.csv`, you need to be
running a d3fend-backend server, this is not yet released.

## Directories

|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|dist/         |Holds distributable ontology files resulting from a build (`make all`).|
|build/       |Holds intermediate files used in build workflow.|
|reports/      |Holds reports generated by report and test targets.|
|src/queries/  |Holds queries and report profiles necessary to update ontology and generate reports.|
|src/ontology/  |Holds the base ontology which is used during the build process to create the distribution.|

## Files

These files are located in the src, build, or dist directories.

> Note: some files are created when `make all` is executed.

|File                       |Purpose                                          |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|d3fend-protege.ttl         |Downloaded D3FEND ontology from webprotege.owl (renamed to match this name).|
|d3fend.{ttl,owl,json}      |D3FEND ontology distribution files.|
|d3fend-public.owl         |Temp merge of original web protege ontology and restrictions as object property assertions.|
|d3fend-res-as-prop.owl     |Temp file containing *just* restrictions as object property assertions between class puns.|
|d3fend-full.owl      |Final inference-enhanced copy with KBs for use in SPARQL end point. This is what is loaded into production Blazegraph.|
|d3fend-architecture.owl |File of architectural elements extracted by a filter-architecture-* target.|
|d3fend.csv              |Tabular form of defensive tactics and techniques trees.|
|d3fend-prefixes.json     |D3FEND ontology context information / namespace prefixes in JSON-LD format; usable by ROBOT and RDFLib.|
|annotations.ttl      |Not currently used; stub of alternative file-based means to add ontology header (see ROBOT documentation).|

## Developer Notes

- Ontology version is specified in `Makefile` as `D3FEND_VERSION`
- Ontology style guide/conventions [here](./CONVENTIONS.md) (work in progress).

## Build with docker

If you have docker and docker-compose, you can build a distribution
in the dist/ folder running

```bash
docker-compose up d3fend-ontology
```
