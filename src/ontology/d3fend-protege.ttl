Analysis of server certificates using active methods to detect if certificates have been misconfigured or spoofed by using elements of the certificate, certificate authorities and signatures.

### Certificate validity analysis
This can be accomplished by verifying the digital signature on certificate.

### Certificate path analysis
The client's browser can perform path verification to ensure that the server's certificate contains a valid trust anchor.

### Certificate configuration analysis
Some browsers can be configured to implement the key-usage extensions contained certificates. This can help to prevent a certificate from being misused.

### Certificate revocation status analysis
Using either Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to determine the revocation status. OCSP Stapling, binding the status with the certificate, helps to mitigate potential delay in status verifications.

## Considerations
* Management of the PKI across the enterprise typically requires automation to maintain scalability and flexibility
* If the certificate authority, issuing the certificate, is compromised then all of the certificates issued by the CA are suspect
* There may be delays associated with updates to certificates
* Revoked certificates give the appearance of valid certificates until they are published to a trusted revocation service (OCSP or CRL)

## Considerations
Active learning is particularly useful in scenarios where data is abundant but labeled instances are scarce or expensive. Examples include speech recognition, information extraction, and document classification.

Active logical link mapping establishes awareness of logical links in the network by sending data over the network to gather information about logical connections in the network.

Typically this will be achieved through network telemetry coordinated for network management and monitoring and will use a link layer discovery protocol such as LLDP and the information gathered and aggregated a higher levels using an application protocol such as SNMP.  The information may be polled by network management softare or configured once and then pushed from network sensors (or agents.)

Another means of establishing network connectivity is by means of sendingn traffic through the use of a tool such as traceroute, to determine the logical paths through the network architecture.

## Considerations

* Best practice is to encrypte network monitoring data and require authentication for queries or admin/management functions.
* Push notifications reduce bandwidth necessary to capture and maintain information if reliable transport is used.
* Special consideration should be made before using of active scanning in OT networks and OT-safe options chosen where available.""" ;

Initially, each data point is treated as an individual cluster, and then in successive iterations, the closest clusters are merged until only one large cluster remains or until a specified stopping criterion is met." ;
    :kb-article """## How it works

Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point as its own cluster. The algorithm then iterates, identifying the two clusters that are closest to each other based on a defined distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan). These two clusters are then merged into a single cluster. This process continues iteratively, merging the closest pairs of clusters in each step until all data points are merged into a single cluster or until other stopping criteria are achieved. A dendrogram, which is a tree-like diagram, can be used to represent the sequence of merges, providing a visual representation of the hierarchical structure of data.

## Considerations

- **Choice of Distance Metric**: The outcome can vary significantly depending on the chosen distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).

- **Scalability**: Agglomerative clustering can be computationally intensive for large datasets.

- **Sensitivity**: The method can be sensitive to outliers, which might affect the quality of the clusters formed.

## Key Test Considerations

- **Unsupervised Learning**:

  - **Number of Clusters**: Determine an optimal number of clusters using the dendrogram and techniques like the elbow method.

- **Cluster Analysis**:

    - **Silhouette Score**: Evaluates how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher silhouette score indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.

    - **Dunn Index**: Measures the ratio between the smallest distance between observations not in the same cluster to the largest intra-cluster distance.

- **Hierarchical Clustering**:

    - **Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient**: Measures the correlation between the distances of points in feature space and their distances on the dendrogram. Helps assess the fidelity of the dendrogram in preserving pairwise distances between samples.

- **Agglomerative Clustering**:

    - **Linkage Criteria**: Test different linkage criteria (e.g., single, complete, average) to determine which produces the most cohesive clusters for the data at hand.

Answer set programming (ASP) is oriented towards difficult (primarily NP-hard) search problems. The computational process employed in the design of many answer set solvers is an enhancement of the DPLL algorithm and, in principle, it always terminates (unlike Prolog query evaluation, which may lead to an infinite loop).

In a more general sense, ASP includes all applications of answer sets to knowledge representation and the use of Prolog-style query evaluation for solving problems arising in these applications.

Given two competing hypotheses and some relevant data, Bayesian hypothesis testing begins by specifying separate prior distributions to quantitatively describe each hypothesis. The combination of the likelihood function for the observed data with each of the prior distributions yields hypothesis-specific models. For each of the hypothesis-specific models, averaging (ie, integrating) the likelihood with respect to the prior distribution across the entire parameter space yields the probability of the data under the model and, therefore, the corresponding hypothesis. This quantity is more commonly referred to as the marginal likelihood and represents the average fit of the model to the data. The ratio of the marginal likelihoods for both hypothesis-specific models is known as the Bayes factor.

Boosting consists of using sequentially weak learners where each iteration’s training focuses on previously misclassified instances in order to improve on the previous iteration. This process is continued iteratively until the final prediction is made by aggregating the previous predictions.

## Considerations
Boosting can be computationally expensive, prone to overfitting, and slower to train compared to other ensemble methods.

There are three main types of Boosting algorithms
 - Adaptive Boosting
Adaptive Boosting (sometimes called AdaBoost) works by adding equal importance to each piece of a dataset and running it through the base learning algorithms. Every algorithm that errors, the boosting algorithm assigns a higher importance to. This continues until an acceptable level of confidence is reached.
 - Gradient Boosting
Gradient Boosting starts by training multiple models simultaneously to gather a strong estimate of strength to build new base learning algorithms.
 - XGBoosting
XGBoosting is a scalable tree boosting model. Using decision trees, weight is assigned to each variable and put into a decision tree. Outputs that are classified by the algorithm as wrong or weak are put into a second decision tree and the results form a stronger model.

    :definition "Analyzing sequences of bytes and determining if they likely represent malicious shellcode." ;
    :kb-article """## How it works

Bytes are analyzed as if they are machine code instructions, and such instructions that are a common component of known shellcode are noted, such as stack pivots, reads from a Memory Address Table, and system calls for functions that disable protections or execute code.  For example, the x86 instruction `b0 0b: mov $11, %ax`, with no further alterations to the `%ax` register, followed by `cd 80: syscall` executes the system call `execve()` in the Linux kernel, which replaces the current process with another one specified -- this is a common action in shellcode, so this sequence would be flagged.

This technique detects shellcode despite whether or not it would cause a buffer overflow in the target binary.

If the sequence of bytes contains a sequence similar to that used in malicious shellcode, the entire byte sequence is flagged and a follow-on technique may be invoked.

## Considerations

### False Negatives
If the shellcode instructions are far apart, simple implementations might not detect the shellcode.

Due to the nature of assembly instructions not having a defined start or end, implementations which do not process all start sequences (for example, when they a find byte sequence of interest, continue scanning forwards from the end of it) might not detect the shellcode.

This technique might not detect more complex or obfuscated instructions.  For that purpose, Dynamic Analysis or Emulated File Analysis could assist by analyzing the actual instruction function.

This technique may not detect self-modifying code.  To make it harder for a process to modify itself, Process Segment Execution Prevention should be used, while noting its considerations.

This technique might not detect malicious shellcode which reuses instructions in the target binary for malicious effect, as memory references in the presumed assembly code are not dereferenced.  Dynamic Analysis and Emulated File Analysis, when set up properly to fork from the running target binary, might detect this.  Process Segment Execution Prevention combined with Segment Address Offset Randomization frequently makes introduction of shellcode through overwriting a saved return pointer more difficult.  Call stack depth analysis might detect excessive reuse of instructions in the target binary.  Shadow Stack Frames might detect that a stack frame's return address has changed and Stack Frame Canary Verification might detect that the stack frame's return address was overwritten.  Other heuristic methods might detect jump-oriented programming shellcode.

With inserting code directly, that it is not a buffer overflow, and just some place where code is executed either to a file or a write-what-where, the buffer overflow mitigations do not help.  Behavioral analysis could detect this, or proper access control could mitigate this.

### False Positives

Byte sequences containing code that is never used as machine code are still analyzed and flagged for anomalies, and [eventually](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55871.html), it is likely that an attack sequence will arise from the sheer volume of bytes transmitted.""" ;

* Certificate Pinning (CP) allows for the client to verify the X.509 certificate with a preloaded certificate. Typically, this is involves storing a hash of the certificate and using the stored hash for comparison to the hash of the certificate submitted during the SSL handshake.

* Public Key Pinning (PKP) requires the extraction of a public key from server's certificate. The stored public key is compared to the server's presented public key. A public key is expected to rotate less frequently than an X.509 certificate and is generally favored over certificate pinning.

An extension of PKP is Subject Public Key Information Pinning (SPKI) includes public key pinning plus additional information for SSL connections. The additional information can include preferred algorithms.

## Considerations

* With pinned certificates whenever a server updates its certificate, the pinned certificates will also need to be updated
* With pinned public keys the extracted key may be subject to key refresh policies but much less frequently
* Servers can become unavailable if pinned objects are set and not updated with the rotated identities. This may require a pinning strategy to be developed.
* The application of this technique within web browser applications has been [deprecated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning) by  popular web browser developers. They now favor certificate analysis via public certificate transparency logs, and the EXPECT-CT HTTP header.""" ;

    :kb-article """## How it works
Classification recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Common classification algorithms are linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest, which are described in more detail below.

## Considerations:

There are many different types of classification algorithms for modeling classification predictive modeling problems.

There is no single theory on how to map algorithms onto problem types; instead, it is generally recommended that a practitioner use controlled experiments and discover which algorithm and algorithm configuration results in the best performance for a given classification task.

## Key Test Considerations

- **Machine Learning**:

  - **Verify the dataset quality**: Check the data to make sure it is
      free of errors.  Quantify the degree of missing values,
      outliers, and noise in the data collection.  If the data quality
      is low, it may be difficult or impossible to create models and
      systems with the desired performance.

  - **Verify development datasets are representative** of expected
      operational environment and data collection means.  Compare
      distributions of dataset features and labels with exploratory
      data analysis and assess the difference in tests on training
      data and tests on evaluation data (where the evaluation data
      must be drawn from a representative dataset.)

  - **Use software libraries**: and tools built for ML where possible, so
      that the underlying code is verified by prior use.**

  - **Diagnose model errors with domain SMEs**: Have problem domain
    SMEs investigate model errors for conditions for which the model
    may underperform and suggest refinements.

- **Classification**:

  - **Use Standard Classification Performance Measures**: Not all of
      the following may be necessary, but should be considered for
      both verification (developmental test) and operational test
      stages use:

    - **Accuracy**: The fraction of predictions that were corret.

    - **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were correct.

    - **Recall**: The proportion of actual positive cases identified correctly.

    - **F-Measure**: Combines the preicion and recall into a single
        score.  It is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.

    - **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve**: A ROC curve
        shows the performance of a classification model at all
        classification thresholds.  It graphs the True Positive Rate
        over the False Positive Rate.

    - **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)**: This measures the
        two-dimensional area under the ROC Curve.  AUC is
        scale-invariant and classification-threshold invariant.

    - **ROC TP vs FP points**: In addition to a specific AUC score,
        the performance at points

    - **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is a table layout that
        allows the visualization of the performance of an
        algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in
        an actual class while each column represents the instances in
        a predicted class, or vice versa. It is a special kind of
        contingency table, with two dimensions ("actual" and
        "predicted"), and identical sets of "classes" in both
        dimensions (each combination of dimension and class is a
        variable in the contingency table.)

  - **Prediction Bias**: The difference between the average of the
      predicted labels and the average of the labels in the data
      set.  One should check for prediction bias when evaluating the
      classifier's results. Causes of bias can include:

    - **Noisy data set**: Errors in original data can as the
      collection method may have an underlying bias.

    - **Processing bug**: Errors in the data pipeline can
      introduce bias.

    - **Biased training sample (unbalanced samples)**: Model
      parameters may be skewed towards majority classes.

	- **Overly strong regularization**: Model may be underfitting
        model and too simple.

	- **Proxy variables**: Model features may be highly
        correlated.

  - **Overfitting and Underfitting**: Overfitting occurs when the the
    model built corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular
    set of data, and thus may fail to fit to predict additional data
    reliably. An overfitted model is a mathematical model that
    contains more parameters than can be justified by the data.
    Underfitting occurs when the model built does adequately capture
    the patterns in the data. As an example, a linear model will
    underfit a non-linear dataset.

## Platforms, Tools, or Libraries:

- **Python**:

  - **scikit-learn**: Is a free software machine learning library for
      Python and includes features for classification.

  - **TensorFlow**: is an end-to-end source machine learning
    platform.

  - **Keras**: is an open-source library that provides a Python API
    designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks.

  - **PyTorch**: Is a machine learning framework based on the Torch
    library.

- **R**:

  - **caret**: Classification And REgression Training package contains
      functions to streamline model training for complex regression
      and classification problems.

  - **randomForest**: Implementation of classification and regression
      based on forest of trees.

Connection Attempt Analysis in multiple ways.

### Monitoring traffic to unallocated IP space
One approach looks for failed connection attempts against unallocated IP space. First, network traffic is captured to map out the network to identify network assets as well as unallocated IP space. The map is then used to determine if connection attempts are being made to the unallocated IP space.

### Monitoring for sequentially transmitted traffic
Another approach passively inspects network traffic with application protocol analyzers observing network activity characteristics such as volume of packets sent/ received, TCP session attributes, and connection information between hosts (start time, source/destination host, services, etc.). Then using pattern matching to identify traffic which appears to be probing for network hosts.

## Considerations

* Implementations that rely on analysis of unallocated IP address space increase in their complexity with network size and decentralized network infrastructure.
* Inventory of unallocated IP space should should be continuously updated to mitigate the risk of false positives.
* IPv6 also introduces challenges including IPv6 traffic bypassing IPv4 specific protection systems (ex. firewalls and IDS) and complexity in managing both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.""" ;

Container images are standalone collections of the executable code and
content that are used to populate a container environment.
They are usually created by either building a container from scratch or by
building on top of an existing image pulled from a repository.

Throughout the container build workflow,
images should be scanned to identify:

- outdated libraries,
- known vulnerabilities,
- or misconfigurations, such as insecure ports or permissions.

Scanning should also provide the flexibility to disregard false positives
for vulnerability detection where knowledgeable
cybersecurity professionals have deemed alerts to be inaccurate.

One approach to implementing image scanning is to use an admission controller
to block deployments if the image does not comply with the organization's
security policies.

An admission controller is a Container Orchestration feature that can intercept and
process requests to the Container Orchestration API prior to persistence of the object,
but after the request is authenticated and authorized.
A webhook can be implemented to scan any image before it is deployed in the orchestrator.
This admission controller

## Considerations

* Image scanning is key to ensuring deployed containers are secure.
* Using trusted repositories to build containers is a critical part of the container build workflow.
* This technique does not necessarly prevent the build process to add insecure or unsecured
  files to the Image.

#### Memory
Credentials may be stored in memory for a variety of reasons; on Windows, they may be stored in lsass.exe.  Once a credential dumper like mimikatz runs and dumps the memory of lsass.exe, the credentials of every account logged on since boot are potentially compromised.
When such an event occurs, this analytic will give the forensic context to identify compromised users. Those users could potentially be used in later events for additional logons.


#### Hard disk
Operating System may cache a certain number of credentials onto the hard disk to use as a source of truth if it cannot contact the credential server.  In many versions of Microsoft Windows, the 10 most recent are cached by default; this setting can be changed in the Microsoft Management Console's Local Security Policy: ```Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Local Policy -> Security Options -> Interactive Logon: Number of previous logons to cache -> 0```  Here we are not concerned with the alteration of the credentials but the fact that they might be read.  If the attacker has physical access to the machine they are unlikely to be stopped from reading files on the filesystem.
"In the event that the domain controller is unavailable Windows will check the last password hashes that has been cached in order to authenticate the user with the system. These password hashes are cached in the following registry setting:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SECURITY\\Cache
Mimikatz can retrieve these hashes if the following command is executed:
lsadump::cache" [1]

The Registry Hive, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SAM, which is stored in the supporting files %systemroot%\\System32\\Config\\{Sam,sam.log,sam.sav}, contains the SAM file.

DC: This is stored in %systemroot%\\ntds\\ntds.dit. (https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/blog/default.aspx?d=10/2017)

Sometimes memory, which contains credentials, could get on the hard disk. Like with hiberfil.sys in Windows.  Equivalent on Linux


In Linux, an attacker could read the /etc/shadow file.

Reading from /proc directory: mimipenguin, many others.

## Considerations
Effective implementation requires identifying any location that could end up containing credentials, and detecting an method of potential access to a source of credential data.

Dead code is code that is considered unreachable by normal program execution. Dead code can be created by adding code under a condition that never evaluates to true. Dead code should be removed since this type of code can produce unexpected results, if accidentally or maliciously forced to execute.

Dead code identification is typically performed by algorithms that implement program flows analysis looking for unreachable code. The dead code is eliminated by instructing compilers to remove the code through compiler flags, i.e., '-fdce' is used for Dead Code Elimination.

## Considerations

    :kb-article """## How it works

A decision tree starts with a root node, which does not have any incoming branches. The outgoing branches from the root node then feed into the internal nodes, also known as decision nodes. Based on the available features, both node types conduct evaluations to form homogenous subsets, which are denoted by leaf nodes, or terminal nodes. The leaf nodes represent all the possible outcomes within the dataset.

## Considerations

While the basic underlying model is that of a decision tree, the decision tree node criteria, and the method for identifying splits varies significantly depending on the learning algorithm selected (e.g., CART, ID3, C4.5, C5.0, CHAID, MARS.)  Extensions like linear and logistic trees can add additional expressiveness as well.

## Key Test Considerations

- **Machine Learning**:

  - **Verify the dataset quality**: Check the data to make sure it is
      free of errors.  Quantify the degree of missing values,
      outliers, and noise in the data collection.  If the data quality
      is low, it may be difficult or impossible to create models and
      systems with the desired performance.

  - **Verify development datasets are representative**: of expected
      operational environment and data collection means.  Compare
      distributions of dataset features and labels with exploratory
      data analysis and assess the difference in tests on training
      data and tests on evaluation data (where the evaluation data
      must be drawn from a representative dataset.)

   - **Use a variety of data sets**: where available and applicable, to
      reflect different operating and environment conditions that are
      likley to be be encountered.

  - **Use software libraries**: and tools built for ML where possible, so
      that the underlying code is verified by prior use.**

  - **Diagnose model errors with domain SMEs**: Have problem domain
    SMEs investigate model errors for conditions for which the model
    may underperform and suggest refinements.

- **Classification**:

  - **Use Standard Classification Performance Measures**: Not all of
      the following may be necessary, but should be considered for
      both verification (developmental test) and operational test
      stages use:

    - **Accuracy**: The fraction of predictions that were corret.

    - **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were correct.

    - **Recall**: The proportion of actual positive cases identified correctly.

    - **F-Measure**: Combines the preicion and recall into a single
        score.  It is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.

    - **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve**: A ROC curve
        shows the performance of a classification model at all
        classification thresholds.  It graphs the True Positive Rate
        over the False Positive Rate.

    - **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)**: This measures the
        two-dimensional area under the ROC Curve.  AUC is
        scale-invariant and classification-threshold invariant.

    - **ROC TP vs FP points**: In addition to a specific AUC score,
        the performance at points

    - **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is a table layout that
        allows the visualization of the performance of an
        algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in
        an actual class while each column represents the instances in
        a predicted class, or vice versa. It is a special kind of
        contingency table, with two dimensions ("actual" and
        "predicted"), and identical sets of "classes" in both
        dimensions (each combination of dimension and class is a
        variable in the contingency table.)

  - **Prediction Bias**: The difference between the average of the
      predicted labels and the average of the labels in the data
      set.  One should check for prediction bias when evaluating the
      classifier's results. Causes of bias can include:

    - **Noisy data set**: Errors in original data can as the
      collection method may have an underlying bias.

    - **Processing bug**: Errors in the data pipeline can
      introduce bias.

    - **Biased training sample (unbalanced samples)**: Model
      parameters may be skewed towards majority classes.

    - **Overly strong regularization**: Model may be underfitting
       model and too simple.

    - **Proxy variables**: Model features may be highly
       correlated.

- **Supervised Learning**:

  - **Overfitting and Underfitting**: Overfitting occurs when the the
    model built corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular
    set of data, and thus may fail to fit to predict additional data
    reliably. An overfitted model is a mathematical model that
    contains more parameters than can be justified by the data.
    Underfitting occurs when the model built does adequately capture
    the patterns in the data. As an example, a linear model will
    underfit a non-linear dataset.

  - **Sensitivity**: Perform N-fold Cross validation to indicate how
    much sensitivity the algorithm has to data variation and to avoid
    overfitting operational models.

- **Decision Tree Learning**:

  - **Sensitive to unbalanced classes**: Examine and determine target
      class balance; decision tree learning algorithms are especially
      sensitive to unbalanced target classes.

  - **Consider decision boundaries**: Perform exploratory data
      analysis to determine if decision boundaries lie alongaxes of
      features. _Decision trees are ideal when decision boundaries can
      be found that lie along axes of features._

   - **Decision tree overfitting** may require tuning algorithm hyperparameters such as tree depth, max features used, max leaf nodes, etc.

   - **Pruning** may result in a more robust model in real-word applications.

   - **Missing values**: Inspect the data set to determine if there
     are missing values and select a means to address them, either by
     choosing an algorithm that works well or a way to impute the
     value or eliminate the missing values in the data sensors or
     pipeline.

## Platforms, Tools, or Libraries

- **scikit-learn**: includes tree algorithms for ID3, C4.5, C5.0, and CART.

- **Weka**: includes J48 (C4.5), SimpleCart (CART), Logistic Model Trees, Naive Bayes Trees, and more.

### Validation Approach
- Use operationally relevant data across the range of application's operating environment.
- Incorporate some kind of continuous validation to address concept drift and the need to retrain the model and/or check data quality.

The core reasoning problems for description logics (DLs) are (usually) decidable, and efficient decision procedures have been designed and implemented for these problems. There are general, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and fuzzy description logics, and each description logic features a different balance between expressive power and reasoning complexity by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors.

DLs are used in artificial intelligence to describe and reason about the relevant concepts of an application domain (known as terminological knowledge). It is of particular importance in providing a logical formalism for ontologies and the Semantic Web: the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and its profiles are based on DLs.

* Constructing and maintaining physical topologies for extensive networks can be challenging and time-consuming using manual methods.

* Another method analyzes information about domains that have been visited, including whether a domain name is longer than a common length,  if a dynamic DNS domain was visited, if a fast-flux domain was visited, and if a recently created domain was visited. These factors are used to develop a score and if that score is over a certain threshold, an alert is generated.
* Collected malware samples can be executed in a virtual environment to identify network domains that are connected to during execution. The network domains are then generated into signatures to identity bad domains for other hosts.

This technique does not check for content hosted at the domain.

## Considerations

* Kernel components can be signed by a certificate obtained by a third party to verify the source of the component and whether it has been modified. When signed, the component will include a signature block implemented as a hash value of the component header and can also include a certificate chain. The signature and certificate data are typically added before the kernel component is distributed to the public.

Analyzing the interaction of a piece of code with a system while the code is being executed in a controlled environment such as a sandbox, virtual machine, or simulator. This exposes the natural behavior of the piece of code without requiring the code to be disassembled.

## Considerations
 * Malware often detects a fake environment, then changes its behavior accordingly. For example, it could detect that the system clock is being sped up in an effort to get it to execute commands that it would normally only execute at a later time, or that the hardware manufacturer of the machine is a virtualization provider.
 * Malware can attempt to determine if it is being debugged, and change its behavior accordingly.
 * For maximum fidelity, the simulated and real environments should be as similar as possible because the malware could perform differently in different environments.
 * Sometimes the malware behavior is triggered only under certain conditions (on a specific system date, after a certain time, or after it is sent a specific command) and can't be detected through a short execution in a virtual environment.

For the case where users detect likely suspicious email files, the organization should consider implementing a means for reporting these emails to their infosec organization.

    :kb-article """## How It Works
When a process encounters an exception, it calls an exception handler to deal with the exception.  The method by which this exception handler is determined varies by the operating system.  The exception handler is called, even if it is the default exception handler to terminate the program and display a message that the program stopped working.  In the case that no valid exception handler is found, the program would fail to proceed as normal and could be programmed to terminate.

In Windows, the address of the exception registration record is stored at the very start of the the Thread Information Block; the GS register points to this structure.

The exception registration record contains two pointers: a pointer to the next exception registration record should this handler fail to handle the exception, and a pointer to the handler.

A buffer overflow can overwrite the saved return pointer with an invalid location to execute memory; this often triggers the exception handler chain, which could also be corrupted by the buffer overflow.  Although Process Exception Handler Validation does not make sure that the exception handler pointer or the code at the exception handler was unaltered, or that the exception handler code is secure, this technique does ensure that the pointer is at least an exception handler that could be called by the program.

With Process Exception Handler Validation, before the handler is called, it checks the exception handler against a source of valid exception handlers.  If the requested handler is not in this list, other techniques such as those in Process Eviction might be invoked, such as Process Termination to end the current process, or Executable Blacklisting to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.

### Runtime valid exception handler source generation
The source of valid exception handlers could be generated at runtime, with the risk of the information that is used to determine the validity of exception handlers being compromised.

### Compile-time
The source of valid exception handlers could also be generated at compile time or as a binary patch.  Given the source code, it would be rather straightforward to find the exceptions, as they are pointed in the catch statement of a try-catch clause and the compiler must already generate the code to call exceptions from this.

## Considerations
If the program file can be altered by the attacker, then the security could be bypassed by replacing it with any desired program, without even bypassing SEH.

If the attacker was already able to overwrite the code for a valid exception handler via other functionality in the program, this defense would not prevent arbitrary code execution.
If an exception handler recognized as valid is vulnerable, it would be executed anyway.

SafeSEH might be applied only to some executable files or modules, allowing an attacker to call any piece of code as an exception handler in the unprotected modules.""" ;

This technique is generic and there are numerous ways to compute and authenticate digital signatures.
A digital certificate is generated from a private/public key pair issued by a certificate authority (CA). A hash of the file is encrypted using the private key. When the file is downloaded by another user, the user's system uses the public key to decrypt the hash and a new hash is created of the downloaded file. The hash decrypted by the public key is compared to the new hash and if there is a mismatch, further techniques, such as file deletion, file quarantine, or **Executable Blacklisting** may be invoked.

This technique may be invoked when deciding whether to execute a file.

#### Criteria

A policy-enforcing application can register an application for denylisting based on conditions including the following:

* File attributes
    * file name
    * file path
    * file hash
    * file publisher, as obtained from the digital signature
    * permissions of the file
* File malware scan (eg. Windows SmartScreen)
* User-File combination

This may be done to prevent execution of applications which are:

* an old version with known vulnerabilities
* without a valid license, which could cause legal issues
* in a directory that is accessible to low-privileged users, that could be accessed by a malware dropper
* known trojan horse programs
* too open in their permissions, possibly set to run as a user other than the originator or allowing execution when they should not be
* a match to the hash of other known malware
* are detected as undesirable based on a file scan runtime behavior

System administrators will customize the rules for the given environment.

#### Backend

The policy-enforcing program may work by running in kernel mode, and [intercepting] [system calls which execute a process].

## Considerations

* If denylisting is done by filename, filepath, or hash, these mechanisms may be a worthy first line of defense and detection, but could still be evaded by an attacker.
* Continuous management is needed to keep the denylist up to date, whether it is based on hash, publisher, behavior, or any other digital artifact.
* Although denylists based on attributes such as file path and virus scan could defend against some threats which they have not been explicitly coded to block, denylists may not provide protection from new, unknown, or zero day attacks.

Conceptually, there are public and private rule sets. Both leverage the same technology, but they are intended to detect different types of cyber adversaries.

## Considerations
* Patterns expressed in the DSLs range in their complexity. Some scanning engines support file parsing and normalization for high fidelity matching, others support only simple regular expression matching against raw file data. Engineers must make a trade-off in terms of:
     * The fidelity of the matching capabilities in order to balance high recall with avoiding false positives,
     * The computational load for scanning, and
     * The resilience of the engine to deal with adversarial content presented in different forms-- content which in some cases is designed to exploit or defeat the scanning engines.
 * Signature libraries can become large over time and impact scanning performance.
 * Some vendors who sell signatures have to delete old signatures over time.
 * Simple signatures against raw content cannot match against encoded, encrypted, or sufficiently obfuscated content.

Symmetric encryption uses the same cryptographic key for both the encryption and decryption a file. Managing keys at scale sometimes uses asymmetric key exchange protocols such as Diffie-Hellman can be used to share the symmetric cryptographic key with the others.

### Asymmetric Cryptography
Asymmetric encryption is typically accomplished using public and private key certificates based on the X.509 standard. Files are encrypted using the public key and decrypted using their private key. Asymmetric encryption is typically slower than symmetric encryption and not widely used for large file encryption, but is popular for key wrapping, key exchanges, and digital signatures.

Tripwire first initializes a database that serves as a basis for comparison and can then scan the system to compare the state of the current file system against the initial baseline database. Additionally, users can define policies that specify potential violations.

Windows - In Microsoft Azure, file integrity monitoring can be enabled which can track file and registry key creation, removals, and modifications of specific files.

## Considerations
Files can change constantly due to the non-static nature of a computer system. File Integrity Monitoring works best when pointed at a narrow scope of critical files to limit the number of unneccessary files that may be modified over the course of normal use.

Adversaries may place files or programs into a computer's file system to perform malicious actions. As part of the eviction process, these files and programs should be removed to prevent further compromise or reinfection. Examples of malicious types of files are malware which is directly harmful and content files with the intent to deceive users (e.g., phishing.)

On Windows systems, antivirus (AV) software should be used to safely and permanently remove malicious files. AV software may first quarantine a suspected malicious file, which is the process of moving a file from its original location to a new location and makes changes so that it cannot be executed. Users can then verify that the file is not benign and then permanently delete it.

## Considerations

When it is determined that a file should be removed for security purposes, the organization--or systems implementing an organization's policies--may determine that the file should not simply be deleted from the enterprise's mission systems, but be quarantined to a secure system by an approved mechanism, so as to allow follow-up investigation by security staff.

On Windows systems, deleting a file in File Explorer does not permanently delete a file - it sends it to the Recycle Bin instead. The Recycle Bin must be emptied, or alternative steps must be performed to remove files completely. Even then, in some cases the data may persist in disk, so data shredder tools may be needed to completely wipe a file. Thus, AV tools are recommended.""" ;

Firmware behavior analysis provides protections by ensuring that installed firmware has not been tampered with or modified. Firmware analysis applies to mutable firmware and immutable read-only memory (ROMs).

Firmware in deployed network devices is typically not analyzed and monitored for vulnerabilities and thus is subject to potential attacks. This technique makes use of known and measured behavioral attributes, including timing attributes, of analyzed firmware on deployed devices.

A behavioral method that employs known timing measurements may use the timing results from a challenge and response protocol to detect the presence of malware in embedded firmware. Firmware device timing measurements are made, specific to the installed device, and are used in the verifying function.

The original firmware image is modified by injecting a monitoring software component into the embedded firmware code. The injected software components will allow for a software root of trust, the challenge and response protocol, to be implement in the firmware.

A challenge-response is issued and includes a nonce so that replays are not allowed. The firmware will calculate a checksum over all of memory, including the nonce, and return the result. The verification system will compare the computed checksum and the time it took for the computation of the checksum to determine if the firmware has been modified.

## Considerations
* The firmware code will need to be modified to include the behavioral monitoring functionality.
* This technique is sensitive to the device the embedded firmware is hosted on and it is expected that the devices and firmware will need to be profiled and analyzed to determine timing estimation.
* This technique is not expected to be one hundred percent correct as you would expect in a hardware root of trust solution and may require some tuning.""" ;

Firmware in deployed network devices is typically not monitored for malicious changes. This technique provides a method to embed a software security component into the deployed firmware which provides a near real-time monitoring hook. The exception handling code, in the firmware, is typically used to expose any detected vulnerabilities.

The injected software components provide a feature similar to intrusion detection systems for the firmware by detecting unauthorized modifications of the embedded firmware. The integrity of static code and firmware data are monitored continuously in the hosted devices. Comparisons are made to monitored elements like firmware memory addresses and data segments. Memory pages are scanned and if a modification is detected the software component may lock the page. This will protect subsequent attempted modifications to the firmware. The software component may utilize the exception handling code and thus be able to disclose the exact address of the modified memory.

The injected software components are inserted during the firmware imaging process. The injected software is assumed to have knowledge of both the embedded code and the current execution state of the host program. The injected software will monitor and alert, in near real-time, on potential suspicious activity. The injected code is run alongside of the embedded code in the host. The injected software operates as an independent entity and is not dependent on the host software.

Finally, this technique may implement other countermeasure techniques as part of their analytical processes. These should be identified by referencing other countermeasure techniques directly as necessary.

    :kb-article """## How it works

For propositions such as "Socrates is a man", one can have expressions in the form "there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man", where "there exists" is a quantifier, while x is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations.

The term "first-order" distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic, in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which quantification over predicates, functions, or both, are permitted.

## Considerations

- Advantages:
-- First-order logic is more expressive than propositional logic; one can talk about objects and their properties, relations between objects.
-- First-order logic is able to make use of variables and quantifiers (e.g., "for all" and "exists".)
-- First-order logic supports power forms of reasoning, such as inferring the properties of an unknown object from the properties of known objects.

- Disadvantages:
-- First-order logic is more difficult to learn and use than propositional logic, due to its greater complexity.
-- First-order logic is also less tractable than propositional logic in many cases; reasoning about quantifiers and variables adds complexity.
-- First-order logic can be difficult to apply in practice, due to the need to find appropriate axioms and rules for each application.

### Verification Approach

- Automated theorem provers can assist in formal verification, performing automated reasoning over system modeled in first-order logic and explore a complete space of system behaviors
- First-order logic may be more expressive than necessary for many types of problems and may be more difficult to verify by SMEs.
- Theorem provers based in FOL are capable of use in software verification tasks, but an SMT solver such as Z3 might be more appropriate.
- Defining a set of competency questions (i.e., query use cases for a first-order logic ontology) can help scope the logic required for a complete solution.

### Validation Approach

- Domain SMEs should be identified to review the analytics results and compare them to expected results for a given input.
- Where possible, an outside team of SMEs should inspect the formal logic specification of a system against its stated requirements and suitability to address its domain problem sets.
- Defining a set of competency questions and the expected results provides one means of validation.

    :kb-article """## How it works

This technique prevents a client from learning IP addresses deemed to be potentially malicious, which would have been delivered via forward resolution responses.

Responses to forward resolution requests (that is, requests where a domain is sent and IP(s) are returned) are collected, and the IP address(es) included as a response are examined. If the IP address(es) are in a range included in the blacklist, then the response is dropped and not forwarded to the client.

The DNS lookup can be blocked by either dropping the network traffic with an inline device, or modifying the value of the response sent by the DNS server. To transparently prevent client applications from hanging on a request, it is common practice to replace malicious values with addresses in the range 127.0.0.0/8 or the address of a honeypot maintained by the network administrators.

## Considerations

* This technique does not prevent the client from contacting the blacklisted IP, only from learning about this IP address via a nameserver lookup request.
* DNS Response traffic can be transmitted over many different protocols, which presents a challenge to implementing methods to extract all DNS answer IP address value(s).
  * DNS has historically used UDP port 53, with TCP port 53 instead used for responses over 512 bytes or after a lack of response over UDP.
  * Usage of new protocols to provide confidentiality for DNS traffic, such as DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS), complicates collection of the IP address(es) in DNS responses. These protocols have often been enabled in browser settings transparently after a browser update, with DNS requests proxied over one of these cryptographic protocols through a specified host.
* This technique must be implemented logically between the application that receives the response and the server which sent the response.
  * DNS responses sent in an encrypted manner, such as those using DoH or DoT, will require interception of the TLS connections in order to determine the IP address(es) in the response.
* Replacing the response is not effective in the case that the nameserver uses a technique to provide integrity of its responses, such as DNSSEC for DNS responses.""" ;

Process isolation, in this context, is address space separation controlled by a security function that limits the communication between processes so that one process cannot directly modify the executing code of another process. For example with virtual address space:

* Process A address space is different from process B address space, which prevents process A from writing to process B

Hardware process isolation is commonly implemented through Direct Memory Access (DMA) which collaborates with a Memory Management Unit (MMU), or Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU). These hardware controls are deployed directly on processors to aid hosts or enclaves in process isolation.

* DMA - Direct memory access allows memory access to occur independently of the program currently run by the microprocessor. DMA allows for I/O devices to directly read from and write to memory, or it can be used to efficiently copy blocks of memory. During DMA transfers, the microprocessor can execute an unrelated program.
* MMU - A memory management unit acts as an access control and is responsible for performing the translation of virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses. The MMU allocates each process its own virtual memory space.
* IOMMU - An input-output memory management unit is used to allocate each I/O device its own virtual address space to the underlying physical addresses. IOMMU allows devices that do not support long memory addresses to address the entire memory space.

## Considerations
* Private hosts may be vulnerable to DMA attack if they have a PCI or PCI Express port that connects attached devices directly to physical address space.

## Implementations:
 * Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (Intel VT-d)
 * Firecracker""" ;

Administrators collect information on hardware devices such as peripherals, NICs, processors, and memory devices that are components of the computers in their architecture using a variety of administrative and management tools that query for this information.  In some cases, where such queries are not supported or provide specific information of interest, an administrator may also collect this information through remote adminstration tools and system commands, either manually or using scripts.

## Considerations
* Scanning and probing techniques using mapping tools can result in side effects to information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems.
* An adversary conducting network enumeration may engage in activities that parallel normal hardware inventorying activities, but would require escalating to admin privileges for most of the operations requiting administrative tools

## Examples
* Bus discovery
   * Admin-scripted PCI Bus inventory using ssh and pciutils
* Application-layer discovery

A driver communicates with the device through the computer bus or communications subsystem to which the hardware connects. When a calling program invokes a routine in the driver, the driver issues commands to the device. Once the device sends data back to the driver, the driver may invoke routines in the original calling program. Drivers are hardware dependent and operating-system-specific.

Identifier activity analysis is the process of taking identifiers--typically known malicious identifiers--and determining the artifacts that have interacted with those identifiers.

There are many open and closed source repositories of identifiers that represent indicators of compromise. For example, VirusTotal contains hash signatures of malware and IP Addresses used by threat actors. Defenders can search for these indicators of compromise their own systems to gain context on activity around an identifier.

## Considerations

Indicator activity analysis is a good way to gain high precision analysis, but adversaries can modify their own signatures such as hashes quickly to evade detection. This is related to David Bianco’s Pyramid of Pain - Indicators on the lower level (hash values, IP addresses domain names) are easy for adversaries to change.

Identifier activity data of interest for analysis with the identifier might include, but is not limited to:

Network appliances are configured to alert on certain packets that typically are involved in DoS attacks.

A sampling period is used to define a time window in which collected counts of the identified packets can be measured. If the collected number of packets exceeds a predefined limit then an alert is generated.

Filtering policies are developed by administrators to meet business requirements and limit connectivity. These policies are implemented on edge devices such as firewalls, routers, and intrusion prevention systems. Examples of filters:

* Blocking incoming traffic from spoofed internally facing IP addresses
* Blocking specific ports and services from establishing connections
* Limiting specific IP ranges from connecting to the network
* Dynamic inbound filtering (Hole punching, STUN, NAT-T)

## Considerations
* Business requirements typically drive the development of filtering rulesets

    :kb-article """## How it works

This technique is used to detect an attacker attempting to exploit and execute code on a target system's call stack using return-oriented programming (ROP). Modern processors that have the ability to maintain a list of the branching calls, e.g., Intel's Last Branch Recording (LBR), can be used to track and analyze indirect branching calls that are indicative of malicious activity.

In order to reduce the number of indirect branch calls to analyze to a manageable set it is assumed that malicious ROP activity will involve the use of system calls.  The technique observes indirect branch calls that are part of paths that lead to system calls, all others are ignored. Branching calls chained together is often referred to as gadgets and gadgets are often used in ROP attacks. Indirect branch calls that involve a transfer from user-space to kernel-space are of interest for this technique.

Identification of potential ROP exploit execution includes:

- Inspecting the LBR when a system function call is made

  - The LBR is configured to return only instruction of interest (ret, indirect jmp, indirect calls)


- Behavior is analyzed for
  - Ret instructions that appear to target areas not preceded by the call sites
  - Sequences of small code fragments that appear to be chained through the indirect branching calls (gadgets)


- Of interest are returns that appear to not render control back after calls
  - Typical ret-call are paired
  - gadgets will appear to have ret followed by instruction of next instruction of the following gadget


## Considerations

* May be operating system dependent since specific system calls are used to scope branching behavoir
* Processors need to support access to a Last Branch Recording list feature
* The size of the LBR stack can limit the expected size of the analyzed execution stack
* If processor does not support LBR then overhead costs for the analysis can be significant""" ;

Input Device Hardening techniques filter certain commands, or disable related operating system functionality.

### Analytics

All of these values can be analyzed and compared to a baseline:

* Amount of input
* Duration of a single input
* Durations between inputs
* Value of input

Context can also include:

* User which is logged in, to include attributes such as physical location of the user
* Date and time
* System which is processing the input
* Source device of input, to include its properties (eg. manufacturer), configuration (eg. keyboard layout) and behavioral attributes of this device (eg. first use)
* Source system of input (local or remote system)
* Other hardware devices attached to the system


### Actions

Actions can include:

* Disabling the source device
* Sending an alert
* Locking the current session (eg. system screen lock, or returning to an authentication screen in a web app) and requiring one or more methods of authentication to continue
* Administratively disabling credentials for the account or the entire account -- the technique *Account Locking*


### Examples
A malicious input device sends many keystrokes with approximately the same delay between each.  This does not match the normal cadence of input, and the device is disabled.

Input to type the session user's name takes abnormally longer for each keystroke.  The system is locked to the password prompt screen.

A system receives key press events from two different devices -- one device sends keystrokes after the other has been idle for a long time.

A system receives physical input in a user session, while that user has sent input from a device located out of the country in the past hour.

Network traffic is suddenly routed through a new external device, and nearly the same volume of network traffic is subsequently sent out the previously existing interface.  The new external device is disabled, and an alert is raised to investigate the network configuration for a potential compromise.

Given some example of legitimate behavioral input patterns, attackers could mimic those input patterns, a technique which has been used in popular culture in the creation of Deepfake videos and [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com).""" ;

Software-based restriction uses agent software installed on a computer system. The agent software monitors all IO port system traffic. The agent software is configurable to limit the use of certain devices connected to IO ports. The restriction software can also be configured to limit the access to files and applications on external storage devices connected to IO ports.

Hardware-based restriction can also be employed to limit access to IO ports. For example, a hardware USB filter device that is placed between the host system and the external devices can filter IO port connections based on configurable rules. When new devices are connected to the USB filter the type of device is determined. Using an allow list a connection determination is made for the device.

Some implementations detect when a device is connected in order to authorize the connection against a list of approved devices, in some cases by device type. For example, if the device is determined to be a storage device, then the contained files and executables are examined to more accurately identify the device type.

Types of restrictions that may be applied:
- Device connection
- Device command filtering
- Device file system read or write restrictions

    :kb-article """## How it works

An example K-center Clustering problem is to mimimize the number of points in a set that are necessary so that a every other point in the set is within some fixed distance of those points.  For instance, given n cities with specified distances, one wants to build k warehouses in different cities and minimize the maximum distance of a city to a warehouse.

## Considerations

- **Scalability**: Exact solutions are NP-hard.  However, algorithms
    that have been proven effective and create no more than 2x the
    optimal set of clusters can run in O(kn) proportional to k*n where
    k is the minimum number of clusters and n is the number of data
    points being clustered.

## Key Test Considerations

- **Unsupervised Learning**:

  - **Number of Clusters**: The Gonzalez (Gon) algorithm guarantees
      creating no more than twice the optimal number of clusters,
      where the optimal number is the minimum number of clusters to
      minimize total distance between representative points in the
      clusters [1].

- **Cluster Analysis**:

    - **Rand Index and Adjusted Rand Index**: Given ground truth set
      of class labels for the data, the Rand Index is a measure of the
      similarity between two data clusterings. The Rand Index is the
      accuracy of determining if a link belongs within a cluster or
      not. A form of the Rand Index may be defined that is adjusted
      for the chance grouping of elements, this is the Adjusted Rand
      Index [5].

    - **Adjusted Mutual Information**: Given ground truth set of class
      labels for the data, Adjusted Mutual Information corrects the
      effect of agreement solely due to chance between clusterings,
      similar to the way the Adjusted Rand Index corrects the Rand
      Index [6].

- **Connection-based Clustering**:

  - **Choice of Distance Metric**: The outcome can vary significantly depending on the chosen distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).

  - **Sensitivity**: Connection-based method can be sensitive to outliers, which might affect the quality of the clusters formed.

- **K-center Clustering**:

  - **Silhouette Score**: The silhouette score refers to a scoring
    method that helps validate the consistency between clusters of
    data. The evaluation technique also produces a concise graphical
    representation of how well each object appear to have been
    classified.  It is suited to K-centric Clustering in that it also
    works for different metric spaces.

  - **Distance Metric**: The distance measure must be a true metric (see
    [2]).  Differences in the metric chosen may (e.g., Euclidean,a
    Manhattan) affect results significantly.

  - **Sensitivity**: Greedy implementations may be sensitive to
    outliers.

## Platforms, Tools, or Libraries

N/A. _Note that this algorithm is relatively simple and so it is
usually implemented from scratch by those incorporating this algorithm
into a system._

    :kb-article """## **How it works**
The goal of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is to identify the nearest neighbors of a given query point, so that we can assign a class label to that point. To determine which data points are closest to a given query point, the distance between the query point and the other data points will need to be calculated. The distance measures used can vary depending on the data set or implementation and help inform decision boundaries, which query points into different regions. Then, by defining the k-value (the number of neighbors to be checked to determine the classification of a specific query point), the data can be assigned its class label.

For classification problems, a class label is assigned on the basis of a majority vote—i.e. the label that is most frequently represented around a given data point is used (the term “majority vote” is commonly used in literature, however, the technique is more technically considered “plurality voting”).  Regression problems use a similar concept as classification problem, but in this case, the average the k nearest neighbors is taken to make a prediction about a classification. The main distinction here is that classification is used for discrete values, whereas regression is used with continuous ones.

Unlike other algorithms that explicitly model the problem, such as linear regression, KNN is instance-based. It means that the algorithm doesn't explicitly learn a model. Instead, it memorizes the training instances and uses them as "knowledge" for the prediction phase. It's also worth noting that the KNN algorithm is also part of a family of “lazy learning” models, meaning that it only stores a training dataset versus undergoing a training stage.

## **Considerations**

* **Scaling:** Scaling is a problem as KNN is a lazy algorithm and takes up more memory and storage compared to other classification methods.

* **Implementation and Hyperparameters:** As KNN only requires a k-value and a distance metric, it is often an easy implementation and can adjust will to new training data.

## Key Test Considerations

- **Supervised Learning:**

  - **Cross Validation:** As cross validation methods like k-fold, leave-one-out, and stratified cross validation can help validate model performance. However, nuances like pessimism bias in k-fold cross validation or high variability in leave-one-out cross validation may need consideration.

- **Classification:**

  - **ROC Curve:**  A standard technique used to summarize classifier performance over a range of tradeoffs between true and false positives is the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

  - **Data Imbalance:** Imbalanced data sets where one class significantly outnumbers others, under sampling techniques like SMOTE may be beneficial in sampling minority classes.

- **K-Nearest Neighbor**

  - **Choice of K:** The number of neighbors, K, affects the decision boundary. A smaller K can lead to a noisy decision boundary, while a large K can smooth it out, but may also blur class distinctions.

  - **K-d Tree:** Exact searching on large datasets can be computationally costly and inefficient. Implementing approximate nearest neighbor algorithms like the K-d tree algorithm.

  - **Dimensionality:** KNN does not perform well while using high-dimensional data and can be sensitive to irrelevant features which can lead to overfitting.

  - **Distance Metric:** Choosing the appropriate distance metric (Euclidean, Manhattan, MinKowski, Hamming etc.) is essential, based on the nature of the data.

    :kb-article """## How it works
Takes independent variables (i.e. covariate, features, predictors, input variables) and dependent variables (i.e. response, output, “thing to be estimated”) and produces the coefficient(s) and intercept for a linear equation (e.g. (β1, β0) for y = β1x + β0) which predicts the relationship between the independent and independent variables by minimizing a cost function, Mean Squared Error, either directly in the case of univariate linear regression or by gradient descent* in the case of multivariate linear regression.

## Considerations
 - There are four principal assumptions required for good results using linear regression (the first letters of the four principal assumptions form the "LINE" mnemonic):
   - Linearity and Additivity
   - Independent Residuals
   - Normal Residual Distributions
   - Equal Variances (i.e. homoscedasticity)
 - Linear regression is a low variance/high bias model.
 - Optimizers like Adam, Batch, and Mini-Batch and others are available for certain applications and data sets.
- A large learning ratio or training coefficient may lead to divergent behavior of the model and too small of values may lead to long run times and inefficiency.


## Verification Approach
 - Models are often evaluated by examining one or more of the metrics of R2, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
 - While there is no generally accepted single best performance metric as a criterion, users of linear regression should consider the suitability of one or more of these metrics for assessing the performance of their model.
 - Use well known data sets to verify model execution.

## Validation Approach
 - Violating the principal assumptions of linear regression results in poor or misleading results.
 - Ensure data is truly representative and if there are any known biases.

Logic rules define a set of patterns that in some patterns must match input data. If the the conditions are met, then the rule will "fire" and some action will be taken, usually notifying a person or another system that the event being monitored needs further processing or attention.

## Key Test Considerations

- **Performance (Accuracy)** Identify instances in data where rule is expected to be triggered. Implement traceability and metrics for individual rule performance. Traceability of cases could be implemented as unit tests or as part of a fine-grained classification performance platform. For simple rule-based matching systems with many rules, individual rules may be unused or may create unusually high false positives (or false negatives relative to expectation.

- **Performance (Computational)** Generate model performance measures (see Classification Performance Measures), esp. a confusion matrix for each rule and identify outliers and relative contribution of rule to overall performance.

    :kb-article """## How it works
Mandatory access control is a non-discretionary access control system because the rules and polices that determine access is determined by a security control authority and not distributed to local users. Access determinations are based on designed access control polices and are not based on local resource owner determinations.

Access is typically granted by defining sets of subjects and sets of objects. Subjects are the entities requesting access and objects are the resources that subjects are trying to access. Rules and policies are defined that associate subjects and object permissions and access controls.

### Common MAC implementations
#### Security label access control
A fine-grained form of mandatory access control is to apply security labels to individual resources, including processes, and the access control decisions are against a particular resource and a given user attempting to gain access. This type of MAC requires that the file system has built-in support for security labels.

Access controls are typically implemented through the use of label identifiers for every file system object. Identifier labels are applied to resources and users are assigned a similar access identifier. Users attempting to access a resource will result in the operating system performing an access control check. The access control check will compare the assigned user's credentials to that of the resource or object they are attempting to access.

A security context is associated with resources and is used to determine assess. Typical basic access control elements include users, roles and types and together they form a security context which is the basis for the security labels.

This type of access control is what is employed in SELinux [2]. This form of MAC is considered the most flexible implementation, but it also is the most complex to deploy across the enterprise. Where multiple virtual machines (VM) are run together this type of access control is typically employed to ensure true isolation of processes and VMs.

#### File path level controls
A less fine-grained form of mandatory access control is to apply security labels that allow for access control at the file path level.  Access control is filesystem agnostic and no relabeling of resources is required. Pathname access control usually seems more natural for implementation and corresponding access audits.

This type of MAC is what is employed in AppArmor [3]. AppArmor was developed to provide a simpler alternative MAC method with much less management overhead. A simple access policy is maintained that defines path resource access rules. Access control attributes are typically associated with programs instead of users.


## Considerations
Some implementations of security label mandatory access control contain complex rules set that are hard to verify and complex to maintain over time.

Initial planning of access model and continuous monitoring of the available users, resources and object is necessary.

## Implementations

 * Linux C-Groups, and policy engines like SELinux and AppArmor
 * Windows Mandatory Integrity Control introduced in Windows Vista

    :kb-article """## How it works

### Digital Signature
Digital signatures are used to verifying a message is from the expected sender. In email, Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocol is typically used to digitally sign messages. A hash value of the sender's message is created and encrypted with the sender's private key to create a digital signature. The message and the digital signature are sent to the recipient where the sender's public key is used to decrypt the digital signature and compute the hash of the message. The computed hash is compared with the hash from the received message, and any difference in the hash values signify the message did not originate from the sender and has been alerted in transit.

### Message Authentication Code (MAC)
MAC is a fixed size string that is appended to a message to provide message authentication and integrity. The sender MAC signing algorithm takes as input a secret symmetric key shared between sender and recipient and the message to calculate a short tag that is appended to the message. The recipient receives the message with the appended tag, and a MAC verification algorithm is run using the symmetric key to verify the message came from the stated sender and ensure the message has not been tampered with.

## Considerations
- Public keys associated with digital signatures should be verified by a Certification Authority (CA) to prevent impersonation. The CA verifies the owner of a public key and puts the sender's identity and public key into a certificate that is signed by the CA.
- Digital signatures provide non-repudiation where a third party can verify the authenticity of the message using the sender's digital certificate signed by the CA.
- Symmetric keys must be exchanged securely via a private channel and management of new symmetric keys are needed for each pair of participants wishing to exchange messages.""" ;

### Asymmetric Cryptography
Asymmetric encryption is typically accomplished using public and private key certificates based on the X.509 standard. The sender encrypts messages using the recipient's public key and the receipt decrypts the message using their private key. Standards that can be used to implement message encryption include S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) and PGP.
### Symmetric Cryptography
Symmetric encryption uses the same cryptographic key by both the sender and receiver to encrypt and decrypt a message. Asymmetric key exchange protocols such as Diffie-Hellman can be used to share the cryptographic key with the recipient.

## Considerations
- Separate configuration settings to enable message encryption are often needed for each messenger client (e.g. webmail, desktop client, mobile).
- Continuous monitoring to ensure private keys are not compromised and the certificate authority (CA) is trusted.
- Secure transfer of private keys between multiple devices.""" ;

Administrators collect information on network nodes in their architecture using a variety of administrative and management tools that query network devices and nodes for information.  In some cases, where such queries are not supported or provide specific information of interest, an administrator may also collect this information through network enumeration methods to include host discovery and scanning for active ports and services.

## Considerations
* Scanning and probing techniques using mapping tools can result in side effects to information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems.
* An adversary conducting network enumeration may engage in activities that parallel normal network node inventorying activities, but would require escalating to admin privileges for most of the operations requiting administrative tools

## Examples
* Link-layer discovery

Network signature analysis relies on predefined patterns, or signatures, to identify malicious network activity. These signatures typically match against specific byte sequences, packet header information, or protocol anomalies indicative of known threats.

The process works as follows:

* Packet Capture: Network traffic is captured on an interface or port, resulting in a stream of raw packets.
* Preprocessing: The captured packets are preprocessed, cleaning and normalizing the data for efficient analysis.
* Signature Matching: Each packet is compared against a database of signatures using dedicated engines.

## Considerations

### False Negatives

Network signature analysis is susceptible to generating false negatives. These occur when malicious activity evades detection due to limitations in the signature-based approach. Here are some common causes:

* Evolving threats: Attackers frequently modify their tactics, rendering existing signatures ineffective against new variants.
* Obfuscation: Attackers may disguise malicious content using encryption, encoding, or other techniques to bypass signature detection.
* Limited visibility: Signatures rely on specific patterns. If crucial information is encrypted or hidden, the signature might miss the threat.
* Zero-day attacks: By definition, new and unknown attacks lack corresponding signatures, allowing them to pass undetected.

### False Positives

Network signature analysis is susceptible to generating false positives. These occur when the signature analysis triggers an alert for benign traffic. Common causes include:

* Overly broad signatures: Rules designed to be too general might match harmless activities, generating false alarms.
* Network misconfigurations: Improperly configured devices or legitimate network activity can mimic malicious patterns, triggering false positives.
* Data errors: Corrupted or incomplete network data can lead to misinterpretations and false alerts.

When a user initiates authentication, they are asked for a one-time password, often in addition to other credentials such as a traditional password or smart card. The one-time password may be from a list provided in advance, sent via a channel such as SMS or HTTPS to an app, or a generated token.

In the case of a physical token which generates one-time passwords incrementally based on time elapsed, that token device need not be connected to the internet. In different implementations, an administrator of the system, or a user with additional verification, can adjust for clock skew between the token and the verification system as needed.

## Considerations

### Compromise of delivery channel
- SIM Swapping
- Secure token visual compromise
- Insecure delivery channel

### Compromise of delivery device
Physical loss of One-time Password device.

### Compromise of long-term backup codes
These are often provided in the form of a downloadable document with a regular name, which can be searched for in the case that the user forgets where they put them.  This digital file or printed document could be stolen.
Additionally, after the code file is printed, it could be recovered from the system printer spool unless the spooler cache is cleared.""" ;

Outbound traffic, in this context, is network traffic originating from a private host or enclave destined towards untrusted networks.
For example:

* An enterprise desktop intranet user connecting to www.example.com
* An internal mail server connecting to an external mail server, mail.example.com

Filtering is commonly implemented as firewall rulesets to limit outbound traffic permitted to egress a host or network. Firewalls are deployed either directly on hosts through kernel level software implementations or installed in-line directly on network links. There are benefits and disadvantages to each approach.

There are various strategies for developing filtering rulesets:

* Block everything by default
* Limit destination hosts
* Limit destination transport or application protocols
* Restrict content outbound (Ex. strings formatted as social security numbers, or proprietary data)

## Considerations
* Dynamic IP assignment creates challenges for Outbound Traffic Filtering because users are not necessarily associated with the same IP address. This can be addressed by linking IP address management information with the filtering logic.
* Connections using non-standard transport layer ports may circumvent outbound traffic filtering technology which does not detect application protocol based on traffic content.
* Business requirements typically drive the development of filtering rule sets.

## Implementations
- iptables (Linux)
- Windows Firewall
- pf (BSD)""" ;

Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.

The OWL languages are characterized by formal semantics. They are built upon the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) standard for objects called the Resource Description Framework (RDF). OWL classes correspond to description logic (DL) _concepts_.  OWL properties to DL _roles_, and individuals are named the same way in OWL and other DLs.

    :kb-article """## How it works
Certificates are analyzed outside of a TLS server connection using third-party secure update logs, domain name analysis and analytics.

### Secure update certificate logs
* Certificate Logs
The key enabling feature is a secure service that maintains record logs of certificate activities. The logs allow users to only append certificates and never to delete or modify the log entries. The logs use Merkle Tree Hashes to ensure they have not been tampered with. The logging service also allows for public auditing by any user.

The logging service, upon receipt of a certificate to log, will respond with a signed certificate timestamp (SCT). The SCT guarantees the certificate will be added to the log within the time specified. The SCT must be present with the certificate during a TLS handshake.

* Certificate Monitoring
Certificate monitoring, of the logs, is typically done by the CA and they watch for suspicious certificate logging and unusual certificates or extensions or permissions. Monitors are also responsible for verifying the logs are accurate and public.

* Certificate Auditors
Log integrity is verified by log auditors. Auditors make use of log proofs are used to validate the cryptographic hashes (Merkle Trees) that the log employs are consistent. In order to ensure consistency throughout multiple monitors and auditors, sharing a common logging service, gossip protocol is employed.

### Phishing domain name analysis
* A curated corpus of known benign domains and phishing domain names is used as training text for machine learning. Through the use of feature set extraction, vectors labels are created with scoring to indicated if they are considered benign or phishing domains.

* A stream of new or updated SSL certificates with fully qualified domain names (FQDN) is analyzed against the feature vectors and a predictive model determines a score for the domains. The scoring considers distance measures such as Levenshtein distance to help in determining the final label score. Supervised learning is also employed using the curated domains of benign and phishing domains.

* Subdomain phishing analysis, prepending a trusted domain to a phishing domain, and regular expression comparisons  are also used in the label scoring model. A tunable measure is used to determine the threshold for alerting. This measure helps to balance between precision and recall measures.

## Considerations
* Some entity will need to run the logging service and a trusted entity is preferred.
* Certificate Authorities will likely need to monitor the logging service for consistency.
* Certificate revocation is unchanged and remains outside of Certificate Transparency, but certificates needing to be revoked are visible.
* Technique dependent of reliable feed of new and updated certificates
* Some certificate authorities allow for certificates to be registered with wildcards in the FQDN and thus will fail some of the subdomain scoring
* Phishing HTTP domains will not be discovered""" ;

    :kb-article """## How It Works

Pointer Authentication (frequently referred to as PAC, although the technique is properly Pointer Authentication) is a security feature to provide protection against attackers with memory read/write access.  A Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) is a cryptographic hash or derivative computed on the value of a pointer and some additional context information which can then provide a cryptographically strong guarantee about the likelihood that a pointer has been tampered with by an attacker.

Although pointers are 64 bits, most systems have a substantially smaller virtual address space, leaving unused bits in pointers that can store the value of the PAC, this can be done to reduce memory space requirements. One implementation is in ARMv8.3-A.  A PAC is computed over the 64-bit pointer value and a 64-bit context value.  Instructions are introduced to deal with pointers: one category to compute and insert the PAC into a pointer, another category to verify the pointer and invalidate the pointer if the PAC does not check, and a third category to remove the pointer and restore the original value without verifying.

The ARM standard specifies a cryptographic algorithm called QARMA-64 (designed by Qualcomm) to compute the signature, although this algorithm is not required.  The architecture provides for five secret 128-bit Pointer Authentication keys: two for instruction pointers, two for data pointers, and a general key for signing larger blocks of data.

## Considerations

In the ARM implementation, the mechanisms above for manipulating PACS are provided, but it is up to the code developer to manage the keys for the cryptographic algorithm.


A known potential limitation of PACs concerns signing gadgets. Under certain circumstances PACs can be bypassed by forcing the system to run a signing gadget which will allow the signing of arbitrary pointers to occur.""" ;

    :kb-article """## How it works
A process code segment is an executable portion of computer memory allocated to a particular process. Process Code Segment Verification implements verification to compare a process code segment to some expected value.

### Verification logic
Verification can occur during application startup, or continuously during execution. The logic which verifies the process code may be separate in a third-party process, embedded in the application itself at compile time, or dynamically linked at runtime.

### System of record
Examples of systems of record:

 * On-disk application binary files or checksums
 * Remotely stored binary data or checksums
 * Embedded binary data or checksums

### Post Verification Actions
If the verification function determines a process code segment may have been altered, a capability may invoke Eviction techniques  as **Process Termination** to end the current process, or **Executable Blacklisting** to prevent the executable from launching in the future.

## Considerations

### False positives

False positives commonly occur in the case that the layout of code in the process segment is legitimately modified:

*  Operating system features or third-party security software may modify the layout of process code, for example in the defensive technique **Segment Address Offset Randomization**, or in the case that a module is rebased.  In both of these cases, the alteration occurs before the code is fully loaded into memory, and it would be possible to avoid the false positive by securely feeding this constant offset and any relocation data into the verification logic.

* Process code segments may be written to modify themselves or other process code segments; however, this goes against widely-accepted current practices in software development.

### False negatives

False negatives can occur via alteration of the verification logic or source of truth, or insufficient verification logic.

* Verification techniques which are executed only locally may be defeated by altering the local verification logic.

* Verification that is run only on a recurring basis could be evaded if the malicious alteration is completed before verification is run.

* Verification that requests an operation to be performed on a subset of the code segment could be evaded by performing that operation on a copy of the relevant bytes of the code segment.

* Verification based on a system of record that can be altered may fail if that system of record is modifiable by a malicious user.""" ;

Process tree analysis techniques gather information on how a process was initiated to determine if a process is malicious. For example, if a process was not initiated from boot or not initiated by another process, that process is identified as suspicious. Also, if a new process was started before a process initiated by the device (ex. during boot) and that new process was not initiated by a user (which can be determined by examining process parameters such as type of process, its creator, source, etc.) the process is identified as suspicious.

For example, Microsoft Word may block execution of any subprocess that is not in an approved path.

## Considerations
* Attackers may spoof the parent PID (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1502/), rendering such after-the-fact analysis on process lineage ineffective.
* Processes may hide from various means of detection; an example on Linux is where a rootkit might remove key files for the process from its directory in /proc.

    :kb-article """## How it works

During execution of a process, the instruction pointer register should only point to addresses in a code segment (also called the .text segment), as this is the sole segment which should contain program code.

When this technique detects an attempt to execute something that has been designated as non-executable, other techniques such as those in **Process Eviction** might be invoked, such as **Process Termination** to end the current process, or **Executable Blacklisting** to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.

### Software-based implementations
The software-based implementation in Windows XP SP2 might not check that every time the instruction pointer is changed, and does not check on each jump or return.  Before calling an exception handler, Windows XP SP2 software-enforced DEP checks whether the exception handler is located in a memory region marked as executable.  If the program was also built with SafeSEH, this implementation also checks before changing control to the exception handler whether it is a registered exception handler in the program's file on disk.

### Hardware-based implementations
The NX (No Execute) or XD (Execute Disable) bit on the processor specifies whether a certain part of memory is executable.  Early implementations set this bit by the memory segment, while modern implementations which are built on the flat memory model often store this bit in each entry of the page table, to control execution by the page.


## Considerations

Non-hardware process data segment execution prevention is more susceptible to being able to be turned off for a page of memory.

Different implementations of this defense have been in place since the 1980s, but implementation stalled when larger 16-bit programs began stuffing code in the segments usually reserved for data. Many modern programs follow the best practice of separation of code and data, are able to run under this defense.

ROP or ret2libc/return-to-function attacks could bypass this defense, as although they may pass attacker-controlled data or stack frames to a function, they abuse functions that are legitimately located in the .text segment (code segment) of the program.  For those, more advanced defenses such as a table of valid jump addresses, function call analysis, or return depth analysis could be used.""" ;

## Considerations

 - Attackers can spoof the parent process identifier (PPID), which could bypass this defense to allow execution of a malicious process from an arbitrary parent process.
 - Attackers could have legitimately compromised any of the process properties, such as the user, to make the execution appear legitimate.
 - Location: If the full image path is not checked, there could be a conflict with an executable that appears earlier due to resolution involving the system environment path/classpath variable.
 - Parsing issues: If the raw command from a shell is analyzed, rather than the actual function call, it is important to identify the actual command  being run from its arguments.  In Windows, services with unquoted file paths containing spaces will try to use the first token as the executable and the rest as arguments -- and shift tokens to the executable until a valid one is found.

### Proprietary technology
Security software might use proprietary technology to terminate processes, instead of the system-provided functions.    Further research may provide specific detail on such methods used.

### System-provided functions

#### Windows tools
In Windows, `ExitProcess()` is used to send a signal to a process to request it to exit, and `TerminateProcess()` is used to force a process to exit.

The `taskkill` executable available in the cmd shell is used to kill a process, with the `/F` switch forcing termination as with `TerminateProcess()`.  In PowerShell, `Stop-Process` is used, which is aliased by default to `spps` and `kill`.  Processes started in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment may be terminated there with the `kill` command.

In some cases, existing drivers can also be leveraged to kill processes.

#### Unix/Linux tools
In Unix-like systems, all process termination requests are handled using signals.  The `kill` function takes the Process ID and signal to send, and is accessible with the `kill` command.  Some shells have a `kill` builtin function which is separate than the `kill` binary, which can also kill background jobs in the shell and additionally perform the function faster, and can run from an existing instance of the shell if the process table is full.  The signal SIGTERM specifies that the process to terminate may invoke a handler that it has defined instead of terminating, and the signal SIGKILL forces immediate termination.

The related command `xkill` terminates the connection of a program to the X window server, after which the user process may decide to terminate itself; however, termination is not guaranteed as the process, which could be on the same or different host, could then run in a terminal or reconnect to a different X server on any host.  Emacs is such a program that would not terminate itself after its connection to the X server is terminated.

## Considerations

### Persistence Mechanisms
Terminating a malicious process is not enough to stop an adversary that has already gained persistence in the host via any initial access mechanism, including through that process or another access mechanism.

### Terminating Multiple Processes
On most operating systems, process termination operations typically occur independently of each other, without functionality provided to atomically terminate multiple processes.  If there are multiple malicious processes which can make system calls to spawn other processes once one of them is closed, user session termination or system restart might be required.

### Process Access Permissions
Users must have permissions to kill the process.  On Unix-like systems, either root or the process user can kill the process.  On Windows systems, process permissions are managed separately via process security tokens.

### Process Resource Handles

#### Terminating Processes with Open Resource Handles

Processes may have open resource handles, which could leave those resources in an undesired state if the process is forced to terminate.  As such, most operating systems provide a means to send a signal to a process to inform it to gracefully terminate, and on most of these operating systems, it is the typical first step used to terminate a process.

#### Signal Traps
As the process may have open resource handles, commonly-used methods of process termination involve sending a signal to the process to terminate.
On Windows, the `ExitProcess()` function is used for this purpose.  Process instructions, as well as a third-party DLL can also cause the process to exit.
On Linux, the process is sent a signal on the occurrence of various events: when it loses the console, `SIGHUP`; when termination is requested, `SIGTERM`.  The processor then redirects execution to the function registered to handle the signal.

Therefore, sending a signal to the process to ask it to terminate may not always work.

##### Avoiding Signal Traps

On Unix-like systems, sending the `SIGKILL` signal for a process does not send a message to the process or invoke an implementation-defined handler; instead, it immediately does not allow the process to execute any further processor instructions.   On Windows `TerminateProcess()` instead of `ExitProcess()` performs the equivalent.

#### Hang on System Call Execution

Even still, as the operating system kernel manages the processes, kernel code may block process signals, including those which cannot be trapped, and does in certain circumstances.  Signals are blocked and queued for the duration of the system call when interrupting the system call would result in a kernel invariant being violated, such as when an action results in a malformed data structure; this blocking is common for filesystem requests.  Such system calls can hang when a filesystem has gone offline, leading to a long-term uninterruptible sleep, represented in POSIX command `ps` output as D state.
Any malicious system calls or system call handlers are issues of a much larger problem (a kernel-level rootkit) and the system should be redeployed entirely or restored from a backup known to be prior to compromise, and other systems accessible directly and indirectly from that one should also be examined.

A process that is truly hung in a system call may prevent the system from shutting down and leave it in an unresponsive state; a hard power off is required.

To speed up the action of terminating a process in uninterruptible sleep, the process resource accesses (handles) could be analyzed.

On Linux, [`sync` followed by `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt) is a safe way to free up some inactive resource handles.


#### Kernel Processes and Threads
The kernel may not allow kernel processes, which are created via methods other than user-space processes, to be terminated.

#### Other Code using the Process

Terminating a shared library can lead to unexpected errors; such shared libraries have their own mechanisms for termination.

On Windows, a DLL is unloaded when the reference count of the library reaches 0.

#### Zombie process

After a process has been terminated, it may still take up an entry in the operating system process table until another event occurs.

##### Windows
In Windows, a process object is deleted when the last handle to the process is closed.

##### Linux
In Linux, a process is removed from the process table when it is reaped by its parent process.  If the parent terminates, historically the parent has been changed to pid 1; however, in the Linux kernel 3.4 and above, processes can set a different process as the subreaper using the `prctl()` system call.

Zombie processes and hung processes could be resolved with a restart of the system.

#### System restart
Finally a system restart might be required to kill a process.
Systems which are only accessible via a remote in-band connection may become inaccessible if a process termination operation that is necessary for reboot does not complete.

### Subsystems
Processes that are started in a subsystem might not be fully terminated if they are terminated using the command for that subsystem.  For example, in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), processes started and terminated via WSL calls such as with the `kill` command in Bash may still have an entry in the Windows process table.""" ;

A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp) is a sequence of characters that specifies a match pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.

## Key Test Considerations

- **External review of regular expressions**: Regular expressions used in rules should be reviewed by a independent developer SME.  Regex testing and visualization tools may be used to aid this review.  Back-tests for failure modes identified during the review shoud be developed.  Regular expressions are easy to get wrong and may appear to work on limited tests; small mistakes can lead to unintended misses and matches.]

- **Processing Performance Review**: Review of resource-intensive rules may be necessary if system performance degraded.  Look for cases of “exponential backtracking”  Some regexes are computationally expensive.

    :kb-article """## How it works
An external attacker takes remote control of a host inside a company or organization's network and manually directs offensive techniques. Nonstandard terminal sessions and abnormal behaviors are analyzed in this technique. Abnormal behavior detection includes analysis of user input patterns in the real-time session, keyboard output and packet inspection.

### Network Traffic Inspection
Network traffic from internal hosts is the main concern and focus for the traffic inspection. The network traffic is collected into inspection groups. The groups of traffic are assembled into distinct pair flows (outbound/inbound) and the pair flows are further divided into sessions. Only sessions originated inside of the network are considered for the inspection. Traffic inspection includes analysis to determine if a human is involved in the session exchanges. Time-based statistics are captured for each session being analyzed by the detection engine.

### Algorithm Analysis Description
Analysis algorithms look for patterns in the network traffic captured from the session data.  A detection engine groups the session traffic data, between the hosts, into rapid exchange instances. Analysis of rapid exchange traffic patterns can lead to the discovery of abnormal behavior which is indicative of a compromised internal host. The analysis algorithms look for patterns in the traffic which correlate to known activity (e.g., relay attacks, bot activity, bitcoin mining). Some metrics used during inspection include the following.

* Number of rapid-exchange instances
* Time interval between packets
* Fixed cadence of traffic
* Rhythm and direction of the initiation of instances
* Volume of data flowing from internal to external controlling host
* Data transfer characteristics
* Variability in length of silent periods

## Considerations
* Full packet capture is required which can be process intensive to analyze
* Attackers that move low and slow may blend in with existing traffic resulting in false negatives""" ;

This technique prevents a client from learning domains deemed to be potentially malicious, which would have been delivered via reverse resolution responses over the DNS protocol.

Queries for reverse resolution requests (that is, requests where IP(s) are sent and a domain is returned) are collected, and the IP address(es) included in the query are examined. If the IP address(es) are in a range included in the blacklist, then the query is dropped.

## Considerations
- The blacklist will have to be maintained and will need to be kept up to date with identified maintenance cycles to ensure lists are not stale.
- DNS query traffic can be transmitted over many different protocols, which presents a challenge to implementing methods to extract all DNS query IP address value(s).
  - DNS has historically used UDP port 53, with TCP port 53 instead used for responses over 512 bytes or after a lack of response over UDP.
  - Usage of new protocols to provide confidentiality for DNS traffic, such as DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS), complicates collection of the IP address(es) in DNS queries. These protocols have often been enabled in browser settings transparently after a browser update, with DNS queries proxied over one of these cryptographic protocols through a specified host.""" ;

A remote procedure call (RPC) enables one computer to execute a specific function on another computer, as if it were a local application process. There are numerous RPC specifications and implementations. RPC capabilities can be abused by attackers in order to achieve a variety of tactical objectives including execution, persistence, initial access, and more. RPC proxies may be used to collect and store RPC traffic. RPCs can occur over network sockets or named pipes.

Analytics look for unauthorized behavior such as:

* Processes being launched or scheduled remotely
* System configurations being changed remotely
* Unauthorized file read activity

Example RPC Protocols:

* DCE/RPC
* CORBA
* Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call
* D-Bus
* XML-RPC
* JSON-RPC
* SOAP
* Apache Thrift

## Considerations
* RPC is widely used in enterprise environments, and significant data filtering may be required in large environments to enable analytic processing.
* RPC traffic may occur over a pipe, or within a host over loopback interface, thus making network collection difficult.""" ;

Scheduled job execution can be utilized by adversaries for the purpose of persistence, conducting remote execution, or gaining privileges. Details of a scheduled job such as associated source files, processes, destination files, or destination servers are first identified and analyzed and then compared against an anti-malware signature database, whitelist, or reputation server. For example, a file associated with a scheduled job to be executed at a specified time or a remote server that is accessed as part of a scheduled task is compared against an anti-malware signature database, whitelist, or reputation server, and if a match is found, execution is denied and an alert is generated.

In addition to traditional scheduled jobs, triggers can be set to execute a specific command after detecting a specific event in the system, such as with WMI Event Subscriptions in Windows.

## Considerations
Jobs can be scheduled in many different and sometimes creative ways through operating system capabilities.""" ;

    :kb-article """## How it works

Many application exploits rely on an attacker specifying a location in memory, which points to data or code used by the attacker.  If the addresses are changed each time the program is run, then it becomes more difficult for the attacker to determine the location that will contain the code they wish to run.

Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as "rebasing."  Just as not all code is built for participation in ASLR, not all modules can be rebased; instead, modules must indicate whether they implement support for rebasing.  Such information to relocate the executable is typically stored in the ".reloc" segment -- each of the addresses pointed to in this segment has its address increased by the amount of the offset.
(An alternative method for relocation would be to add an amount to a global variable each time -- leading to less overhead in the module load, but more for each access.  Still another implementation could instead contain code to deference each changeable memory location on the fly, so that each of the references do not need to be updated.


## Considerations

As the offset for each segment is constant, it is possible to guess at the value of the address given the address of another variable.  Alternatively, memory pointers may be kept around, which contain the address of another variable.
Another bypass technique is known as an "egg hunt," whereby the attacker searches for a rather unique piece of the data or code in memory to determine its likely address.

The program needs to store these addresses for the functions somewhere.  In Linux, the PLT contains a "trampoline" to these addresses.  If an attacker desires to jump to the start of an existing function, they can jump directly to the trampoline anyway, and may have the opportunity to provide their own stack frame to the function with a write to the stack. If they overwrite a saved stack pointer which is loaded back into memory, or execute a function, that changes the address of a stack pointer.

If an attacker wants to inject some data into the program, for example as a parameter to a known function that is not under ASLR or a pointer to a trampoline function in the PLT, then they can repeat the data until they exceed the range of ASLR coverage, which on 32-bit systems is accomplishable in a few seconds with a heap spray.  Microsoft's EMET and Windows 10 Exploit Guard can pre-allocate particular addresses that are commonly used in heap sprays.  However, in many products, there does not seem to be nearly a complete coverage of such addresses, which only need to be executable and in the range of the heap; 0x0c0c0c0c is such an address that is commonly used for the x86 processor architecture, as when executed it only performs a numeric operation to a register four times.""" ;

Shortcuts, which are supported by the graphical file browsers of some operating systems, may resemble symbolic links but differ in a number of important ways. One difference is what type of software is able to follow them:

 - Symbolic links are automatically resolved by the file system. Any software program, upon accessing a symbolic link, will see the target instead, whether the program is aware of symbolic links or not.

 - Shortcuts are treated like ordinary files by the file system and by software programs that are not aware of them. Only software programs that understand shortcuts (such as the Windows shell and file browsers) treat them as references to other files.

Another difference are the capabilities of the mechanism:

 - Microsoft Windows shortcuts normally refer to a destination by an absolute path (starting from the root directory), whereas POSIX symbolic links can refer to destinations via either an absolute or a relative path. The latter is useful if both the location and destination of the symbolic link share a common path prefix[clarification needed], but that prefix is not yet known when the symbolic link is created (e.g., in an archive file that can be unpacked anywhere).

- Microsoft Windows application shortcuts contain additional metadata that can be associated with the destination, whereas POSIX symbolic links are just strings that will be interpreted as absolute or relative pathnames.

- Unlike symbolic links, Windows shortcuts maintain their references to their targets even when the target is moved or renamed. Windows domain clients may subscribe to a Windows service called Distributed Link Tracking to track the changes in files and folders to which they are interested. The service maintains the integrity of shortcuts, even when files and folders are moved across the network.[14] Additionally, in Windows 9x and later, Windows shell tries to find the target of a broken shortcut before proposing to delete it.""" ;

Most buffer overflows overwrite memory from lower to higher memory addresses, so in order to overwrite the return pointer (and thus take control of the process) the canary value must also be overwritten. This value is checked to make sure it has not changed before a routine uses the return pointer on the stack.

    :kb-article """## How it works

This defense must be applied at compile-time, or via a patch to the program binary.  Stack Frame Canary Verification inserts instructions at the prologue and epilogue of desired functions.  In the prologue, a canary value, typically with the same size as the register size, is stored in the system of record and on the stack.  Typically, the canary is loaded to where it has a memory address just below that of the saved instruction pointer and base pointer.  In the epilogue, the canary value stored on the stack and, is compared to the canary value in the system of record.  If the values are different, other techniques such as those in Process Eviction might be invoked, such as Process Termination to end the current process, or Executable Blacklisting to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.

Stack Frame Canary Verification is commonly used to detect potential tampering of a saved register value on the stack before it has been restored.  Examples of registers with values commonly saved to the stack include the instruction pointer and the base pointer.

The canary should be stored between where the start of a buffer overrun is likely, and the data to protect, in cases where the buffer size increases it will overwrite the data to be protected.

On most processor architectures, including x86, x64, and ARM, a "push" operation to store data to the stack grows the stack towards a lower memory address.  As in these architectures, saved register values are stored to the stack at a point in time just before space is made for the local function variables, the saved register values have a higher address than that of the local function variables.  Values at increasing indexes of a buffer are written to increasing memory addresses; therefore, an overwrite in the local variable buffer could overwrite saved register values, and a stack canary between these two would be useful in detecting an overwrite.

On some other processor architectures such as the B5000, the stack grows towards increasing memory addresses, and some architectures, such as System Z and RCA1802A, stack direction can be chosen.  If the stack grows towards increasing memory addresses, while this architecture inherently provides more protection against a saved register being overwritten, other data including local function variables might be overwritten.


## Considerations

There are several ways that the protection provided by a canary could be rendered ineffective.

### Performing a malicious action before the canary is checked

If the attacker alters the memory in such a way that it performs a malicious action before the epilogue is called, then this protection will not be effective.  This includes altering the logic of the program by altering the values of local variables stored on the function stack, or by causing an exception and exploiting the exception mechanism such as the SEH (Structured Exception Handling) mechanism on Windows.

### Determining the canary value

Determining the canary value is possible through reading memory either for the code used to check the canary, or from the stored canary value itself in a stack frame.

### Changing the canary value

A vulnerability such as a write-what-where condition that allows one to write data after the canary in the stack, would allow control of the value of the saved instruction pointer without needing to know the canary value.""" ;

A basic example of string searching is when the pattern and the searched text are arrays of elements of an alphabet (finite set) Σ. Σ may be a human language alphabet, for example, the letters A through Z and other applications may use a binary alphabet (Σ = {0,1}) or a DNA alphabet (Σ = {A,C,G,T}) in bioinformatics.

In practice, the method of feasible string-search algorithm may be affected by the string encoding. In particular, if a variable-width encoding is in use, then it may be slower to find the Nth character, perhaps requiring time proportional to N. This may significantly slow some search algorithms. One of many possible solutions is to search for the sequence of code units instead, but doing so may produce false matches unless the encoding is specifically designed to avoid it.

    :kb-article """## How it works

System calls are APIs between a user application and the operating system [1].

By analyzing a process's use of these APIs, it is, in some cases, possible to ascertain whether a program is exhibiting unauthorized behavior, including trying to escalate its privileges.

### Gathering System Calls
A common method to capture system calls is to use kernel APIs to hook [2] a process's system call invocations.

The Linux system call `ptrace` tracks other system calls in a process and allows their alteration; this is made use of by GDB.  `strace` utilizes `ptrace` and will print to stdout each system call invoked. Other applications record this data in local or remote databases.

The log entry for each system call, which may reference additional information such as the date and time, and the process tree for the process which made the system call, is relayed, in real time or post-facto, to an analysis module which consults a catalog or model to determine whether the distribution matches a known-good or known-bad pattern.


### Analysis

System calls are analyzed with a variety of methods. Some analytics look for specific sequences of instructions, others may apply statistical methods to identify abnormal behavior. Sequences of instructions can be abstracted into conceptually higher order user activities, for example:

* An attacker executes many system calls in a short period of time, with several sequences which could be used to escalate privileges.
* Getting the contents from a URL, writing to a new file, and then executing the same file.
* A ransomware program which either uses a loop or creates many threads to: read a specified file, encrypt its contents, create an output file with a similar name to the original file, and delete the unencrypted original.

## Considerations

* Duplicative or extraneous system calls may be added to malware to defeat analytics.
* Malware could replace API hooking instructions to allow system calls to be made without being monitored.
* A model built from a training set of system calls and related data may not be updated fast enough to detect new threats.

Required Launch Daemons parameters include a <code>Label</code> to identify the task, <code>Program</code> to provide a path to the executable, and <code>RunAtLoad</code> to specify when the task is run. Launch Daemons are often used to provide access to shared resources, updates to software, or conduct automation tasks.(Citation: AppleDocs Launch Agent Daemons)(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence)(Citation: launchd Keywords for plists)" .

    :kb-article """## How it works
During the boot process, the BIOS boot block (which with this defense enabled, is the Core Root of Trust for Measurement) measures boot components (firmware, ROM). The TPM hashes those measurements and stores the hashes in Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs).  Upon a subsequent boot, these hashes are provided to a verifier which compares the stored measurements to the new boot measurements. Integrity of the boot components is assured if they match.

Attestation of the secure boot occurs when a verifying entity requests a Quote which is a concatenation of the requested PCR values, hashed and signed by the TPM's unique RSA key.  The TPM signature is trusted because the private key is stored securely in hardware and never leaves the TPM.

## Considerations

* The TPM does not perform the follow-on actions of acting on the PCR value information, it just provides the PCR stored information.
* The current version of TPM is 2.0.; most existing implementations use TPM 1.2.

    :kb-article """## How it works
Transfer Agent Authentication can be accomplished in different ways for depending on the protocol. In Email, Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Key Identified Email (DKIM) or Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) are used to validate sender domain ownership.

### SPF
SPF protocol allows for mail domain owners to specify the mail servers they use when sending email. SPF requires the use of SPF records published in the Domain Name System (DNS). The records record the authorized IPs for email senders. SPF uses the return-path address for domain IP identification. Email that is forwarded may cause the return-path validation problems.
### DKIM
DKIM also uses a record entry in DNS for authentication but does not rely on the simple return-path for validation. A signature header is added to email and encryption is used for security. This adds an additional layer of complexity and requires that DKIM servers be configured identified cryptographic signatures. The additional complexity results in a validation process that can survive complex routing of emails.

### DMARC
DMARC is an email policy and authentication protocol that seeks to ensure that the "From" field of emails is not spoofed. DMARC makes use of both SPF records and DKIM published key validation. DMARC also has a decision policy framework, contained in a DMARC record, for handling of rejected email. The DMARC framework also updates DMARC domains with authentication statues for allowed senders of that domain.

## Considerations
- Additional work is required to ensure that all SPF, DKIM and DMARC records are current and up to date.
- Maintenance of DKIM signing keys is needed.
- Using SPF without DKIM and DMARC verifies the Return-Path domain however does not prevent spoofing of the displayed From: address.
- Parts of an email that are not signed or verified by email authentication methods, such as the message body or the header To: and Subject: fields, can be altered or modified.
- Email message authentication does not replace the need to do email content analysis since executables, attachments, or links or other parts of the email beyond the sender domain are not verified.""" ;

URLs may contain components, for example:

 * scheme
 * userinfo
 * host name
 * port
 * path
 * query
 * fragment

These components are used as features in analysis algorithms.

Contextual information about a URL such as where it is embedded (ex. emails, files, network protocols), header, path, location, and origin information, as well as information about the content returned from the URL request, may be incorporated into an analytic for URL analysis. For example, if a URL indicates a .pdf file but an executable is actually returned, the combination of these two pieces of information indicates suspicious activity.

Additional techniques include:

* Extracting features of a URL such as domain name length, ratio of consecutive consonants, percentage of digits in a domain, and number of vowels. Values for each feature are combined to develop a score for the URL.
* Determining the probability of a character occurring in the URL given the preceding two characters. For example, for google.com, the probability of a 'g' occurring at the beginning of a word, the probability of an 'o' occurring after a "g, the probability of an o" occurring after a 'g' and "o, and so forth. A dictionary or a list of known good domains is used to determine probability. Probabilities are multiplied to develop a score for the URL.

URL analysis may trigger follow-on analytics such as **File Analysis**

## Considerations

* Volume of URLs being analyzed, combined with the speed at which they are analyzed
* Fidelity of analysis technique at detecting brand new URLs versus analyzing URLs of established domains""" ;

User web session data is collected over a period of time to create a user behavior profile. Data collected includes clicks made on a website, average time between clicks, filling out web forms, order in which pages are viewed, and downloading files. Current user web session behavior is then compared against the use behavior profile to identify anomalies and a likelihood that the current user web session is malicious. Current user web session behavior can also be compared to predetermined known malicious behavior profiles that are developed through analysis of malware in run time at a threat research facility.

## Considerations
* Potential for false positives from anomalies that are not associated with malicious activity.
* Attackers may not differentiate their web session activity enough to trigger an alert.""" ;

The deception data objects 214 may include, for example, one or more of the following:

Cookies and/or history log entries. In case the access client 255 is browsing, for example, to a supplier-facing website (an exemplary resource 222) of the protected network 235, typically, a cookie is added to the to be added to the access client 255 and the website's address added to the history log of the access client 255. In such a case, the campaign manager 216 may, for example, open an iframe to a deception website (an exemplary deception resource 210 corresponding to the exemplary resource 222) in which different cookie(s) and/or different history log entry(s) may be added to the access client 255. The different cookie(s) and/or history log entry(s) may point to the deception environment, for example, a false website, an identical system that is not used by real users (internal and/or external), a proxy that redirects to a real system within the protected network 235, a different service, such as, for example, email, SharePoint and/or the like.

JavaScripts, pop-up windows, pop-under windows and/or any other browsing technique used to browse to another website(s). In case the access client 255 is browsing, for example, to the supplier-facing website, the campaign manager 216 may, for example, initiate a JavaScript, a pop-up window and/or a pop-under window to direct the access client 255 to the deception website in which the different cookie(s) and/or the different history log entry(s) may be added to the access client 255. The JavaScripts, the pop-up windows and/or the pop-under windows may maintain a visibility similarity with the supplier-facing website such that they do not significantly alter the browsing experience of the external user(s) using the access client(s) 255.

Credential object. In case the external user(s) use the RDP serving as the access client 255, upon login of the RDP, the campaign manager 216 may install additional fake credentials on the external endpoint 251 from which the RDP is initiated.

Configuration file. In case the external user(s) use the RDP serving as the access client 255, upon login of the RDP, the campaign manager 216 may install a fake remote access configuration file on the external endpoint 251 from which the RDP is initiated.

Deception file, password and/or the like. In case the external user(s) use the VNC serving as the access client 255, the campaign manager 216 may install additional fake credentials, files, password(s) and/or the like on the external endpoint 251from which the VNC is initiated.

In some cases, the access client 255 may be offered with automatic password completion when accessing a resource, a service and/or an application at the remote network. In such case(s), the campaign manager 216 may manipulate the automatic password completion and provide fake password(s) to the access client 255 accessing the protected network 235.

Archive files, for example, zip, rar, tar.gz and/or the like. In case the external user(s) using the access client 255 performs a backup and/or retrieves data from the protected network 235, the campaign manager 216 may insert one or more deception data objects 214 into one or more of the created archive files.

An account. The campaign manager 216 may provide the external user(s) one or more false accounts for accessing one of more of the deception applications 212. The campaign manager 216 may configure each of the deception data objects 214 to interact with one or more of the deception resources 210. The campaign manager 216 may configure the deception data objects 214 and define their relationships according to a deception policy and/or methods defined for the deception campaign. Naturally, the campaign manager 216 creates and configures the deception data objects 214 according to the resource(s) 222 accessed by the access client(s) 255. The campaign manager 216 also defines the interaction with the deception resource(s) 210 which map the accessed resource(s) 222. For example, the deceptive data object 214 of type "browser cookie" may be created to interact with one or more deception resources 210, for example, a fake website and/or a deception application launched using, for example, a deception resource 210 of type "browser" created during the deception campaign. As another example, a deceptive data object 214 of type "compressed file" may be created for external user(s) using a certain one of the external endpoints 251. As another example, a deceptive data object 214 of type "credentials" may be created for users accessing a certain application 212 of type "ERP". Optionally, the campaign manager 216 periodically and/or dynamically updates one or more of the deception data objects 214 to impersonate an active real (valid) processing environment such that the deception data objects 214 appear to be valid data objects to lead the potential attacker to believe the emulated deception environment is a real one.""" .

In one embodiment, a system implementing an active firewall is provided which includes methodology for verifying or authenticating communications between network components (e.g., sensor(s), arbiter, and actor(s)), using cryptographic keys or digital certificates. Certificates may be used to digitally sign a message or file and, in a complementary manner, to verify a digital signature. At the outset, particular software components that may participate in authenticated communication are specified, including creating a digital certificate for each such software component. Upon detection by a sensor that an event of interest that has occurred in the computer network system, the system may initiate authenticated communication between the sensor component and a central arbiter (e.g., \"event orchestrator\") component, so that the sensor may report the event to the arbiter or \"brain.\" Thereafter, the arbiter (if it chooses to act on that information) initiates authenticated communication between itself and a third software component, an \"actor\" component (e.g., \"firewall\"). The arbiter may indicate to the actor how it should handle the event. The actor or firewall, upon receiving the information, may now undertake appropriate action, such as dynamically creating or modifying rules for appropriately handling the event, or it may choose to simply ignore the information." ;

    :kb-abstract "The invention provides a system and method for automatic creation of adaptive behavioral profiles for observables associated with resource states and events in a computer network (IT) infrastructure of an enterprise and for detecting anomalies that represent potential malicious activity and threats as deviations from normal behavior. Separate profiles may be created for each behavioral indicator, as well as for each time series of measurements, and aggregated to create an overall behavioral profile. An anomaly probability is determined from the behavioral profile and used to evaluate the data values of observables. Outlier data values which deviate from normal behavior by more than a predetermined probability threshold are identified for risk analysis as possible threats while inliers within the range of normal behavior are used to update the behavioral profile. Behavioral profiles are created for behavioral indicators based upon observables measured over predetermined time periods using algorithms employing statistical analysis approaches that work for any type of data distribution, and profiles are adapted over time using data aging to more closely represent current behavior. Algorithm parameters for creating profiles are based on the type of data, i.e., its metadata." ;

For example, users can be grouped by their job title, organizational hierarchy, or location and can be observed for similarities in access patterns, based on granted access entitlements or actual logged resource access.

Behavioral profiles are created from measurements of events over a time period for example:

A Remote Procedure Call is initiated by communicating to the RPC Endpoint Mapper, which exists as the Windows service RpcEptMapper and listens on the port 135/tcp. The endpoint mapper resolves a requested endpoint/interface and responds to the client with the port that the service is listening on. Since the RPC endpoints are assigned ports when the services start, these ports are dynamically assigned from 49152 to 65535. The connection to the endpoint mapper then terminates and the client program can communicate directly with the requested service.

RPC is a legitimate functionality of Windows that allows remote interaction with a variety of services. For a Windows environment to be properly configured, several programs use RPC to communicate legitimately with servers. The background and benign RPC activity may be enormous, but must be learned, especially peer-to-peer RPC between workstations, which is often indicative of Lateral Movement.""" ;

To detect this activity, a sensor is needed at the network level that can decode RPC traffic or on the host where the communication can be detected more natively, such as Event Tracing for Windows. Using wireshark/tshark decoders, the WMI interfaces can be extracted so that WMI activity over RPC can be detected.

PMD captures these predicted future evolutions in signatures of as yet unseen malware variants to function as a malware vaccine. These signatures of predicted future malware “evolutions” can be added to the training set of a machine-learning (ML) based malware detection and/or mitigation system so that it can detect these new variants as they arrive." ;

We show with concrete code examples that several standard optimizations, which have been formally proved correct, inhabit this correctness-security gap. We analyze this gap and conclude that it arises due to techniques that model the state of the program but not the state of the underlying machine. We propose a broad research program whose goal is to identify, understand, and mitigate the impact of security errors introduced by compiler optimizations. Our proposal includes research in testing, program analysis, theorem proving, and the development of new, accurate machine models for reasoning about the impact of compiler optimizations on security." ;

    :kb-abstract """What if online scammers weren't sure whether the user account they are targeting is really yours, or whether the information they compiled about you is real? It's worth considering whether decoy online personas might help in the quest to safeguard our digital identities and data.

I believe deception tactics, such as selective and careful use of honeypots, holds promise for defending enterprise IT resources. Some forms of deception could also protect individuals against online scammers and other attackers. This approach might not be quite practical today for most people, but in the future we might find it both necessary and achievable.

Human attackers and malicious software pursue user accounts and data on-line through harvesting, phishing, password-guessing, software vulnerabilities, and various other means. How might we use decoys to confuse, misdirect, slow down and detect adversaries engaged in such activities?

...

The wealth of personal details available on social networking sites allows attackers to target individuals using social engineering, secret question-guessing and other techniques. For some examples of such approaches, see The Use of Fake or Fraudulent LinkedIn Profiles and Data Mining Resumes for Computer Attack Reconnaissance.

Setting up one or more fake social network profiles (e.g., on Facebook) that use the person's real name can help the individual deflect the attack or can act as an early warning of an impending attack. A decoy profile could purposefully expose some inaccurate information, while the person's real profile would be more carefully concealed using the site's privacy settings. Decoy profiles would be associated with spamtrap email addresses.

Similarly, the person could expose decoy profiles on other sites, for instance those reveal shopping habits (e.g., Amazon), musings (e.g., Twitter), skills (e.g., GitHub), travel (e.g., TripIt), affections (e.g., Pinterest), music taste (e.g., Pandora) and so on.

In one embodiment, a response policy zone (RPZ) application generates an RPZ that includes contexts for the on-line threats that are associated with domain names. For a domain name that is associated with an on-line threat, the RPZ application determines a threat specification that describes a characteristic of the on-line threat. The RPZ application then generates an alias based on the domain name and the threat specification. Subsequently, the RPZ application generates a domain name system (DNS) resource record that maps the domain name to the alias, includes the resource record in the RPZ, and transmits the RPZ to a DNS name server that implements the RPZ. Upon receiving a DNS query associated with the domain name, the DNS name server generates a DNS response based on the alias.

These activities are then analyzed to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs). These indicators are then fed into a forensics analysis engine, which then quickly decides whether a subject (e.g., process, user) is malicious. If so, the system takes some proactive action to alert a proper authority, to quarantine the potential attack, or to provide other remediation.

primary exploitation technique for system compromise
in the presence of non-executable page protections. ROP
exploits are facilitated mainly by the lack of complete

In this paper we present a practical runtime ROP exploit prevention technique for the protection of thirdparty applications. Our approach is based on the detection of abnormal control transfers that take place during
ROP code execution. This is achieved using hardware
features of commodity processors, which incur negligible runtime overhead and allow for completely transparent operation without requiring any modifications to
the protected applications. Our implementation for Windows 7, named kBouncer, can be selectively enabled for
installed programs in the same fashion as user-friendly
mitigation toolkits like Microsoft's EMET. The results of
our evaluation demonstrate that kBouncer has low runtime overhead of up to 4%, when stressed with specially
crafted workloads that continuously trigger its core detection component, while it has negligible overhead for
actual user applications. In our experiments with in-thewild ROP exploits, kBouncer successfully protected all
tested applications, including Internet Explorer, Adobe

The dependent DLL, once processed, executes a number of operations to ensure the driver associated with the agent is initialized first. Furthermore, if the initialization order is modified, an alert is provided to the kernel-mode component that notifies the kernel-mode component it was not first and the order had to be altered.

    :kb-abstract "Fileless malware are recent threats to computer systems that load directly into memory, and whose aim is to prevent anti-viruses (AVs) from successfully matching byte patterns against suspicious files written on disk. Their detection requires that software-based AVs continuously scan memory, which is expensive due to repeated locks and polls. However, research advances introduced near-memory and in-memory processing, which allow memory controllers to trigger basic computations without moving data to the CPU. In this paper, we address AVs performance overhead by moving them to the hardware, i.e., we propose instrumenting processors’ memory controller or smart memories (near- and in-memory malware detection, respectively) to accelerate memory scanning procedures. To do so, we present MINI-ME, the Malware Identification based on Near- and In-Memory Evaluation mechanism, a hardware-based AV accelerator that interrupts the program’s execution if malicious patterns are discovered in their memory. We prototyped MINI-ME in a simulator and tested it with a set of 21 thousand in-the-wild malware samples, which resulted in multiple signatures matching with less than 1% of performance overhead and rates of 100% detection, and zero false-positives and false-negatives." ;

    :kb-abstract """Buffer overflow attacks continue to be a major security problem and detecting attacks of this nature
is therefore crucial to network security. Signature based network based intrusion detection systems (NIDS)
compare network traffic to signatures modelling suspicious or attack traffic to detect network attacks. Since
detection is based on pattern matching, a signature modelling the attack must exist for the NIDS to detect it, and
it is therefore only capable of detecting known attacks. This paper proposes a method to detect buffer overflow
attacks by parsing the payload of network packets in search of shellcode which is the remotely executable
component of a buffer overflow attack. By analysing the shellcode it is possible to determine which system
calls the exploit uses, and hence the operation of the exploit. Current NIDS-based buffer overflow detection
techniques mainly rely upon specific signatures for each new attack. Our approach is able to detect previously
unseen buffer overflow attacks, in addition to existing ones, without the need for specific signatures for each
new attack. The method has been implemented and tested for buffer overflow attacks on Linux on the Intel x86
architecture using the Snort NIDS.""" ;

Engineering-based solutions are essential to managing the growing complexity, dynamicity, and interconnectedness of today’s systems, as exemplified by cyber-physical systems and systems-of-systems, including the Internet of Things. This publication addresses the engineering-driven perspective and actions necessary to develop more defensible and survivable systems, inclusive of the machine, physical, and human components that compose the systems and the capabilities and services delivered by those systems. It starts with and builds upon a set of well-established International Standards for systems and software engineering published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and infuses systems security engineering methods, practices, and techniques into those systems and software engineering activities.

The parts of the control assessed by each determination statement are called control items. The control items are then grouped into the appropriate security capabilities. As suggested by SP 800-53 Revision 4, security capabilities are groups of controls that support a common purpose. For effective automated assessment, testable defect checks are defined that bridge the determination statements to the broader security capabilities to be achieved and to the SP 800-53 security control items themselves. The defect checks correspond to security sub-capabilities-called sub-capabilities because each is part of a larger capability. Capabilities and sub-capabilities are both designed with the purpose of addressing a series of attack steps. Automated assessments (in the form of defect checks) are performed using the test assessment method defined in SP 800-53A by comparing a desired and actual state (or behavior)." ;

The platform is a collection of fundamental hardware and firmware components needed to boot and operate a system. A successful attack on platform firmware could render a system inoperable, perhaps permanently, or requiring reprogramming by the original manufacturer, resulting in significant disruptions to users. The technical guidelines in this document promote resiliency in the platform by describing security mechanisms for protecting the platform against unauthorized changes, detecting unauthorized changes that occur, and recovering from attacks rapidly and securely. Implementers, including Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and component/device suppliers, can use these guidelines to build stronger security mechanisms into platforms.

    :kb-abstract "Various families of malware use domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to generate a large number of pseudo-random domain names to connect to a command and control (C&C) server. In order to block DGA C&C traffic, security organizations must first discover the algorithm by reverse engineering malware samples, then generating a list of domains for a given seed. The domains are then either preregistered or published in a DNS blacklist. This process is not only tedious, but can be readily circumvented by malware authors using a large number of seeds in algorithms with multivariate recurrence properties (e.g., banjori) or by using a dynamic list of seeds (e.g., bedep). Another technique to stop malware from using DGAs is to intercept DNS queries on a network and predict whether domains are DGA generated. Such a technique will alert network administrators to the presence of malware on their networks. In addition, if the predictor can also accurately predict the family of DGAs, then network administrators can also be alerted to the type of malware that is on their networks. This paper presents a DGA classifier that leverages long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to predict DGAs and their respective families without the need for a priori feature extraction. Results are significantly better than state-of-the-art techniques, providing 0.9993 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for binary classification and a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.9906. In other terms, the LSTM technique can provide a 90% detection rate with a 1:10000 false positive (FP) rate---a twenty times FP improvement over comparable methods. Experiments in this paper are run on open datasets and code snippets are provided to reproduce the results." ;

If the request is to start an existing service with a known command line, the the SCM process will run the corresponding command.

This compound behavior can be detected by looking for services.exe receiving a network connection and immediately spawning a child process.""" ;

For adversaries to achieve this, they must open a WMI connection to a remote host. This RPC activity is currently detected by CAR-2014-11-007. After the WMI connection has been initialized, a process can be remotely launched using the command: wmic /node:"<hostname>" process call create "<command line>", which is detected via CAR-2016-03-002.

This leaves artifacts at both a network (RPC) and process (command line) level. When wmic.exe (or the schtasks API) is used to remotely create processes, Windows uses RPC (135/tcp) to communicate with the the remote machine.

After RPC authenticates, the RPC endpoint mapper opens a high port connection, through which the schtasks Remote Procedure Call is actually implemented. With the right packet decoders, or by looking for certain byte streams in raw data, these functions can be identified.

When the command line is executed, it has the parent process of C:\\windows\\system32\\wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe. This analytic looks for these two events happening in sequence, so that the network connection and target process are output.""" ;

To detect this behavior, look for files that are written to a host over SMB and then later run directly as a process or in the command line arguments. SMB File Writes and Remote Execution may happen normally in an environment, but the combination of the two behaviors is less frequent and more likely to indicate adversarial activity.

This can possibly extend to more copy protocols in order to widen its reach, or it could be tuned more finely to focus on specific program run locations (e.g. %SYSTEMROOT%\\system32) to gain a higher detection rate.""" ;

A transaction is proposed by a seller, and the buyer signals his acceptance by entering his personal authentication information comprising a PIN and at least one biometric sample, forming a commercial transaction message. The commercial transaction message is forwarded to the computer system, where the computer system compares the personal authentication information in the commercial transaction message with previously registered buyer biometric samples. If the computer system successfully identifies the buyer, a financial account of the buyer is debited and a financial account of the seller is credited, and the results of the transaction are presented to both buyer and seller. As a result of the invention, a buyer can conduct commercial transactions without having to use any tokens such as portable man-made memory devices such as smartcards or swipe cards. The invention allows buyers to quickly select one of a group of different financial accounts from which to transfer funds. The invention further indicates to the user that the authentic computer system was accessed by the use of a private code that is returned to the buyer after the identification is complete.

A child-initiated request to communicate with the parent process is then received by the parent process. In order to verify the identity of the child-initiated request, the parent process impersonates the child process and receives as identifier that identifies the requestor child process. The requestor process identifier and the spawned child identifier are compared. Based on the comparison, the parent process responds to the child-initiated request. In another embodiment, process identifiers are used by the parent process to verify the identity of a child process the requests communication with the parent process." ;

Each guest VM includes a vShim layer for managing kernel accesses to user space and guest accesses to kernel space. The vShim layer also maintains a separate set of page tables from the kernel page tables. In one embodiment, data in the user space is encrypted and the kernel goes through the vShim layer to access user space data. When the kernel attempts to access a user space address, the kernel exits and the vShim layer is launched to process the request. If the kernel has permission to access the address, the vShim layer copies the data to a region in kernel space and then returns execution to the kernel." ;

Keystroke dynamics is a behavioral biometric, this means that the biometric factor is 'something you do'.

Already during the second world war a technique known as The Fist of the Sender was used by military intelligence to distinguish based on the rhythm whether a morse code message was send by ally or enemy. These days each household has at least one computer keyboard, making keystroke dynamics the easiest biometric solution to implement in terms of hardware.

With keystroke dynamics the biometric template used to identify an individual is based on the typing pattern, the rhythm and the speed of typing on a keyboard. The raw measurements used for keystroke dynamics are dwell time and flight time.""" ;
