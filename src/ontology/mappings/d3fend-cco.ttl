# Class Mappings

d3f:DigitalInformation rdfs:subClassOf cco:InformationContentEntity .

d3f:DigitalInformationBearer rdfs:subClassOf cco:InformationBearingArtifact .

# Note: The obo: prefix doesn't resolve in the ROBOT merge, so full IRI specified.
# d3f:DigitalArtifact rdfs:subClassOf obo:BFO_0000002 . # obo:BFO_0000002 aka "continuant"
d3f:DigitalArtifact rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000002> .

  # Note: d3f:DigitalArtifact cannot be a subclass of bfo:BFO_0000040
  # aka "material entity" nor bfo:BFO_00000030 "object" as it is
  # parent to both d3f:DigitalIinformation a subclass of "information
  # content entity" (information itself) which is "generically
  # dependent continuant" in BFO and d3f:DigitalInformationBearer a
  # subclass of "information bearing artifact" which is "independent
  # continuant" in BFO.

d3f:Action rdfs:subClassOf cco:Act .

d3f:DigitalEvent rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000035> .
# All digital events in d3fend look like punctual events to me, and thus like process boundaries. In
# case that some of them are not, we could map specific subclasses to process or process boundary

d3f:Activity rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000015> .

# Note: The obo: prefix doesn't resolve in the ROBOT merge, so full IRI specified...
# d3f:Weakness rdfs:subClassOf obo:BFO_0000016 .        # obo:BFO_0000016 aka "disposition"
d3f:Weakness rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000016> .


d3f:Agent owl:equivalentClass cco:Agent . # Tentative, see note below.

  # Note: The cco:Agent definition states that a cco:Agent is "A
  # Material Entity that is capable of performing Planned Acts.". That
  # may overspecify D3FEND sense of d3f:Agent, which might be a
  # reactive agent (any arbitrary system that can perform an
  # act/actuate, which may not have the intention suggested by the CCO
  # definition in cco:AgentOntology.

  # While at present cco:IntentionalAct (aka "Planned Act") only
  # states the agent is following a Directive Information Content
  # Entity (DICE).  The instructions within Software components could
  # be interpreted as DICE, but an algorithm being DICE is not
  # generally also a type of "Intentional Act"/"Planned Act";
  # definitely not in Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) sense highly
  # associated with agent-based model of thinking.)


d3f:Organization rdfs:subClassOf cco:Organization.

# d3fend only allows persons to be members of organizations, while CCO also allows 
# other organizations to be part of an orgaization

d3f:Person owl:equivalentClass cco:Person.

# d3fend seems to only refer to human beings with "person", just as CCO does

d3f:PhysicalObject rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000030>.

# BFO 0000030 is "object". The two classes might be equivalent, but there may also be
# other classes in d3fend which are not subclasses of PhysicalObject that fall under
# BFO:0000030

d3f:Technique rdfs:subClassOf cco:DirectiveInformationContentEntity.

# techniques seem to be akin to plans or other similar regulatory information artifacts.

d3f:InformationContentEntity owl:equivalentClass cco:InformationContentEntity.

d3f:Log rdfs:subClassOf cco:RepresentationalInformationContentEntity .

# An example cco gives of a representational ICE is a transcript, which seems similar to a log.

d3f:Sensor owl:equivalentClass cco:Sensor .

d3f:Artifact rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000002> .

#obo:BFO_0000002 aka "continuant".
#like Digital Artifact, it can't be a subclass of Material Artifact or Object for the same reason. 
#Though the definition they give of Artifact is cco Material Artifact, which can't be right for this reason.

d3f:Capability owl:equivalentClass cco:AgentCapability .

#they say it's defined by dbpedia and linked a definition for capability in 'systems engineering', 
#but I didn't find anything in the definition that made it seem like the definition wasn't applicable
#to capability in general. 

d3f:DigitalObject rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000002> .

#obo:BFO_0000002 aka "continuant".
#If this is the place Digital Artifact needs to go, it's also where Digital Object should go, since Digital Artifact is a subclass of Digital Object.

d3f:Monitoring owl:equivalentClass cco:ActOfObservation .

#They define monitoring as an act of observing something. They also add that it might involve keeping a record of something.

d3f:Procedure rdfs:subClassOf cco:DirectiveInformationContentEntity .

#This seems like a Plan. They don't give a definition of Procedure, and the only subclass is Use Case Procedure.

d3f:Vulnerability rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000016> .

#obo:BFO_0000016 aka "disposition".
#Like 'Weakness', Vulnerability seems like a disposition.

d3f:AnalysisOfAlternatives rdfs:subClassOf cco:Act .

#This might further be a planned act. They don't define this term, so it's difficult to tell.

d3f:Assessment rdfs:subClassOf cco:ActOfAppraisal .

#They define it as classifying something according to its worth.

d3f:Command rdfs:subClassOf cco:DirectiveInformationContentEntity .

#Command is defined as being a directive to a computer program.

d3f:Identifier rdfs:subClassOf cco:DesignativeInformationContentEntity .

#The definition of Identifier says it's a name, but Designative ICEs include non-name identifiers.
#I therefore made identifier a subclass rather than equivalent to Designative ICE.

d3f:JobSchedule rdfs:subClassOf cco:Plan .

#
# Property Mappings
#

# General Note: The obo: prefix doesn't resolve in the ROBOT merge, so
# full IRI specified where BFO concepts referenced.

# Note: The bo:contains property means something different than
# d3f:contains; it is spatial containment between material and
# immaterial entities

d3f:contains rdfs:subPropertyOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000051> .     # obo:BFO_0000051 aka "has part"
d3f:contained-by rdfs:subPropertyOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050> . # obo:BFO_0000050 aka "part of"
