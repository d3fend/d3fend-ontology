# Class Mappings
#
d3f:DigitalInformation rdfs:subClassOf cco:InformationContentEntity .

d3f:DigitalInformationBearer rdfs:subClassOf cco:InformationBearingArtifact .

# Note: The obo: prefix doesn't resolve in the ROBOT merge, so full IRI specified.
# d3f:DigitalArtifact rdfs:subClassOf obo:BFO_0000002 . # obo:BFO_0000002 aka "continuant"
d3f:DigitalArtifact rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000002> .

  # Note: d3f:DigitalArtifact cannot be a subclass of bfo:BFO_0000040
  # aka "material entity" nor bfo:BFO_00000030 "object" as it is
  # parent to both d3f:DigitalIinformation a subclass of "information
  # content entity" (information itself) which is "generically
  # dependent continuant" in BFO and d3f:DigitalInformationBearer a
  # subclass of "information bearing artifact" which is "independent
  # continuant" in BFO.

d3f:Action rdfs:subClassOf cco:Act .
#in order to decide about this mapping, we have to decide whether d3f:DefensiveTechnique and 
# d3f:OffensiveTechnique are acts or more similar to plans.

d3f:DigitalEvent rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000035> .
# Most if not all events in d3fend look like punctual events to me, and thus like BFO_0000035, aka process boundaries. In
# case that some of them are not, we could map specific subclasses to process or process boundary.

d3f:Activity rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000015> .

# Note: The obo: prefix doesn't resolve in the ROBOT merge, so full IRI specified...
# d3f:Weakness rdfs:subClassOf obo:BFO_0000016 .        # obo:BFO_0000016 aka "disposition"
d3f:Weakness rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000016> .


d3f:Agent owl:equivalentClass cco:Agent . # Tentative, see note below.

  # Note: The cco:Agent definition states that a cco:Agent is "A
  # Material Entity that is capable of performing Planned Acts.". That
  # may overspecify D3FEND sense of d3f:Agent, which might be a
  # reactive agent (any arbitrary system that can perform an
  # act/actuate, which may not have the intention suggested by the CCO
  # definition in cco:AgentOntology.

  # While at present cco:IntentionalAct (aka "Planned Act") only
  # states the agent is following a Directive Information Content
  # Entity (DICE).  The instructions within Software components could
  # be interpreted as DICE, but an algorithm being DICE is not
  # generally also a type of "Intentional Act"/"Planned Act";
  # definitely not in Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) sense highly
  # associated with agent-based model of thinking.)


d3f:Organization rdfs:subClassOf cco:Organization.

# d3fend only allows persons to be members of organizations, while CCO also allows 
# other organizations to be part of an orgaization. Thus the CCO class is slightly broader.

d3f:Person owl:equivalentClass cco:Person.

# d3fend seems to only refer to human beings with "person", just as CCO does.

d3f:PhysicalObject rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000030>.

# BFO 0000030 is "object". The two classes might be equivalent, but there may also be
# other classes in d3fend which are not subclasses of PhysicalObject that fall under
# BFO:0000030

d3f:Technique rdfs:subClassOf cco:DirectiveInformationContentEntity.

# techniques seem to be akin to plans or other similar regulatory information artifacts. Nevertheless,
# techniques are currently under "action", which looks like it refers to processes. This boils down to 
# whether d3f:technique is meant to refer to the techniques before they are executed or only after they 
# are executed. In the first case, they are similar to plans, in the other, they may refer to processes.
# Another way to look at this is to see whether d3f:technique are time indexed or not (e.g. my message
# analysis technique started today at 8 pm)

d3f:DefensiveTechnique rdfs:subClassOf cco:DirectiveInformationContentEntity.

#see d3f:Technique

d3f:OffensiveTechnique rdfs:subClassOf cco:DirectiveInformationContentEntity.

#see d3f:Technique

d3f:InformationContentEntity owl:equivalentClass cco:InformationContentEntity.
# this seems to be intended to be equivalent to the CCO class. Notice that many other d3f classes
# will become subclasses of cco:InformatioContentEntity, and thus of the d3f:InformationContentEntity class
# as well. For example, if 

d3f:Log rdfs:subClassOf cco:InformationContentEntity .

# An example cco gives of a representational ICE is a transcript, which seems similar to a log. But it might also 
# be considered a descriptive ICE, so for this can be a subclass of ICE.

d3f:Sensor owl:equivalentClass cco:Sensor .

# A subclass of sensor they include is cyber sensor, which might be referring to programs which are ICEs.
# If this is the case, this class is not equivalent to cco:Sensor, which is only about physical entities. 

d3f:Artifact rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000002> .

#obo:BFO_0000002 aka "continuant".
#like Digital Artifact, it can't be a subclass of Material Artifact or Object for the same reason. 
#Though the definition they give of Artifact is cco Material Artifact, which can't be right for this reason.

d3f:Capability owl:equivalentClass cco:AgentCapability .

# the question is whether d3f:Capability can be borne by agents only, or whether there are broader entities
# which can have capabilities. If this is the case, we should use a broader capability class from some neighboring
# BFO ontology.

d3f:DigitalObject rdfs:subClassOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000002> .

#obo:BFO_0000002 aka "continuant". What is the difference between d3f:DigitablObject and d3f:Information Content Entity?

d3f:Monitoring rdfs:subClassOf cco:ActOfObservation .

# cco:ActOfObservation mentions "senses" which might or might not be the case for 
# d3f:monitoring, which on the other hand might involve information processing monitoring procedures which are not tied to senses.

d3f:AnalysisOfAlternatives rdfs:subClassOf cco:Act .

#This also seems to be an act, or a planned act. 

d3f:Assessment rdfs:subClassOf cco:ActOfAppraisal .

#Appraisal seems to be akin to classifying ad understood in d3f.

d3f:Identifier rdfs:subClassOf cco:DesignativeInformationContentEntity .

#The definition of Identifier says it's a name, but Designative ICEs include non-name identifiers.
#I therefore made identifier a subclass rather than equivalent to Designative ICE.

d3f:JobSchedule rdfs:subClassOf cco:Plan .

# Property Mappings
#

# General Note: The obo: prefix doesn't resolve in the ROBOT merge, so
# full IRI specified where BFO concepts referenced.

# Note: The bo:contains property means something different than
# d3f:contains; it is spatial containment between material and
# immaterial entities

d3f:contains rdfs:subPropertyOf <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000051> .     # obo:BFO_0000051 aka "has part"
